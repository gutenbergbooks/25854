<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Since</span> our publication of "The Letters of Charles
Dickens" we have received the letters addressed to
the late Lord Lytton, which we were unable to procure
in time for our first two volumes in consequence of
his son's absence in India. We thank the Earl of
Lytton cordially for his kindness in sending them to
us very soon after his return. We also offer our
sincere thanks to Sir Austen H. Layard, and to the
senders of many other letters, which we now publish
for the first time.</div>

<p>With a view to making our selection as complete
as possible, we have collected together the letters from
Charles Dickens which have already been published
in various Biographies, and have chosen and placed
in chronological order among our new letters those
which we consider to be of the greatest interest.</p>

<p>As our Narrative was finished in our second volume,
this volume consists of Letters <i>only</i>, with occasional
foot-notes wherever there are allusions requiring
explanation.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Hullah</span>,</div>

<p>Have you seen <i>The Examiner?</i> It is rather depreciatory
of the opera; but, like all inveterate critiques
against Braham, so well done that I cannot help laughing
at it, for the life and soul of me. I have seen <i>The Sunday
Times</i>, <i>The Dispatch</i>, and <i>The Satirist</i>, all of which blow
their critic trumpets against unhappy me most lustily.
Either I must have grievously awakened the ire of all
the "adapters" and their friends, or the drama must be
decidedly bad. I haven't made up my mind yet which of
the two is the fact.</p>

<p>I have not seen the <i>John Bull</i> or any of the Sunday
papers except <i>The Spectator</i>. If you have any of them,
bring 'em with you on Tuesday. I am afraid that for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
"dirty Cummins'" allusion to Hogarth I shall be reduced
to the necessity of being valorous the next time I
meet him.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My Dear Hullah</span>,</div>

<p>Mr. Hogarth has just been here, with news which
I think you will be glad to hear. He was with Braham
yesterday, who was <i>far more full</i> of the opera<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> than he
was; speaking highly of my works and "fame" (!), and
expressing an earnest desire to be the first to introduce
me to the public as a dramatic writer. He said that he
intended opening at Michaelmas; and added (unasked)
that it was his intention to produce the opera within <i>one
month</i> of his first night. He wants a low comedy part
introduced&mdash;without singing&mdash;thinking it will take with
the audience; but he is desirous of explaining to me what
he means and who he intends to play it. I am to see him
on Sunday morning. Full particulars of the interview
shall be duly announced.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shall see you meanwhile. I have only time
to add that I am</p>

<div class='sig'>
Most faithfully yours.<br />

<span class="smcap">Petersham</span>, <i>Monday Evening (1836).</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Hullah</span>,</div>

<p>Since I called on you this morning I have not had
time to look over the words of "The Child and the Old
Man." It occurs to me, as I shall see you on Wednesday
morning, that the best plan will be for you to bring the
music (if you possibly can) without the words, and we can
put them in then. Of course this observation applies only
to that particular song.</p>

<p>Braham having sent to me about the farce, I called on
him this morning. Harley wrote, when he had read the
whole of the opera, saying: "It's a sure card&mdash;nothing
wrong there. Bet you ten pound it runs fifty nights.
Come; don't be afraid. You'll be the gainer by it, and
you mustn't mind betting; it's a capital custom." They
tell the story with infinite relish. I saw the fair
manageress,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who is fully of Harley's opinion, so is Braham.
The only difference is, that they are far more enthusiastic
than Harley&mdash;far more enthusiastic than ourselves even.
That is a bold word, isn't it? It is a true one, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, sir," said Braham to Hogarth yesterday,
when he went there to say I should be in town to-day,
"depend upon it, sir, that there has been no such music
since the days of Sheil, and no such piece since "The
Duenna."" "Everybody is delighted with it," he added, to
me to-day. "I played it to Stansbury, who is by no means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
an excitable person, and he was charmed." This was said
with great emphasis, but I have forgotten the grand point.
It was not, "I played it to Stansbury," but, "I sang it&mdash;<i>all
through!!!</i>"</p>

<p>I begged him, as the choruses are to be put into
rehearsal directly the company get together, to let us have,
through Mrs. Braham, the necessary passports to the stage,
which will be forwarded. He leaves town on the <i>8th of
September</i>. He will be absent a month, and the first
rehearsal will take place immediately on his return;
previous to it (I mean the first rehearsal&mdash;not the return)
I am to read the piece. His only remaining suggestion is,
that Miss Rainforth will want another song when the piece
is in rehearsal&mdash;"a bravura&mdash;something in the 'Soldier
Tired' way." We must have a confab about this on
Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Harley called in Furnival's Inn, to express his high
delight and gratification, but unfortunately we had left
town. I shall be at head-quarters by 12 Wednesday noon.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Believe me, dear Hullah,</span><br />
Most faithfully yours.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Tell me on Wednesday when you can come down
here, for a day or two. Beautiful place&mdash;meadow for
exercise, horse for your riding, boat for your rowing, room
for your studying&mdash;anything you like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>As you have begged me to write an original sketch
for the first number of the new evening paper, and as I
trust to your kindness to refer my application to the proper
quarter, should I be unreasonably or improperly trespassing
upon you, I beg to ask whether it is probable that if I
commenced a series of articles, written under some attractive
title, for <i>The Evening Chronicle</i>, its conductors would
think I had any claim to some additional remuneration (of
course, of no great amount) for doing so?</p>

<p>Let me beg of you not to misunderstand my meaning.
Whatever the reply may be, I promised you an article, and
shall supply it with the utmost readiness, and with an
anxious desire to do my best, which I honestly assure you
would be the feeling with which I should always receive
any request coming personally from yourself. I merely
wish to put it to the proprietors, first, whether a continuation
of light papers in the style of my "Street Sketches"
would be considered of use to the new paper; and,
secondly, if so, whether they do not think it fair and
reasonable that, taking my share of the ordinary reporting
business of <i>The Chronicle</i> besides, I should receive something
for the papers beyond my ordinary salary as a
reporter.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>Begging you to excuse my troubling you, and taking
this opportunity of acknowledging the numerous kindnesses
I have already received at your hands since I
have had the pleasure of acting under you,</p>

<div class='sig'>
I am, my dear Sir, very sincerely yours.<br />

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Doughty Street</span>, <i>Thursday Night, October 26th, 1837.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Hogarth</span>,</div>

<p>I need not thank you for your present<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of yesterday,
for you know the sorrowful pleasure I shall take in wearing
it, and the care with which I shall prize it, until&mdash;so far as
relates to this life&mdash;I am like her.</p>

<p>I have never had her ring off my finger by day or night,
except for an instant at a time, to wash my hands, since
she died. I have never had her sweetness and excellence
absent from my mind so long. I can solemnly say that,
waking or sleeping, I have never lost the recollection of
our hard trial and sorrow, and I feel that I never shall.</p>

<p>It will be a great relief to my heart when I find you
sufficiently calm upon this sad subject to claim the promise
I made you when she lay dead in this house, never to shrink
from speaking of her, as if her memory must be avoided,
but rather to take a melancholy pleasure in recalling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
times when we were all so happy&mdash;so happy that increase
of fame and prosperity has only widened the gap in my
affections, by causing me to think how she would have
shared and enhanced all our joys, and how proud I should
have been (as God knows I always was) to possess the
affections of the gentlest and purest creature that ever shed
a light on earth. I wish you could know how I weary
now for the three rooms in Furnival's Inn, and how I miss
that pleasant smile and those sweet words which, bestowed
upon our evening's work, in our merry banterings round
the fire, were more precious to me than the applause of a
whole world would be. I can <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'recal'">recall</ins> everything she said and
did in those happy days, and could show you every passage
and line we read together.</p>

<p>I see <i>now</i> how you are capable of making great efforts,
even against the afflictions you have to deplore, and I hope
that, soon, our words may be where our thoughts are, and
that we may call up those old memories, not as shadows
of the bitter past, but as lights upon a happier future.</p>

DIARY&mdash;1838.</div>

<div class='date'><br />
<i>Monday, January 1st, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A sad New Year's Day in one respect, for at the
opening of last year poor Mary was with us. Very many
things to be grateful for since then, however. Increased
reputation and means&mdash;good health and prospects. We
never know the full value of blessings till we lose them
(we were not ignorant of this one when we had it, I hope).
But if she were with us now, the same winning, happy,
amiable companion, sympathising with all my thoughts
and feelings more than anyone I knew ever did or will,
I think I should have nothing to wish for, but a continuance
of such happiness. But she is gone, and pray
God I may one day, through his mercy, rejoin her. I wrote
to Mrs. Hogarth yesterday, taking advantage of the
opportunity afforded me by her sending, as a New Year's
token, a pen-wiper of poor Mary's, imploring her, as
strongly as I could, to think of the many remaining
claims upon her affection and exertions, and not to give
way to unavailing grief. Her answer came to-night,
and she seems hurt at my doing so&mdash;protesting that in
all useful respects she is the same as ever. Meant it for
the best, and still hope I did right.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Saturday, January 6th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Our boy's birthday&mdash;one year old. A few people at
night&mdash;only Forster, the De Gex's, John Ross, Mitton, and
the Beards, besides our families&mdash;to twelfth-cake and
forfeits.</p>

<p>This day last year, Mary and I wandered up and down
Holborn and the streets about for hours, looking after a
little table for Kate's bedroom, which we bought at last at
the very first broker's which we had looked into, and which
we had passed half-a-dozen times because I <i>didn't like</i>
to ask the price. I took her out to Brompton at night,
as we had no place for her to sleep in (the two mothers
being with us); she came back again next day to keep
house for me, and stopped nearly the rest of the month.
I shall never be so happy again as in those chambers
three storeys high&mdash;never if I roll in wealth and fame. I
would hire them to keep empty, if I could afford it.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Monday, January 8th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I began the "Sketches of Young Gentlemen" to-day.
One hundred and twenty-five pounds for such a
little book, without my name to it, is pretty well. This
and the "Sunday"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by-the-bye, are the only two things
I have not done as Boz.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Tuesday, January 9th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>Went to the Sun office to insure my life, where the
Board seemed disposed to think I work too much.
Made Forster and Pickthorn, my Doctor, the references&mdash;and
after an interesting interview with the Board and
the Board's Doctor, came away to work again.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Wednesday, January 10th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>At work all day, and to a quadrille party at night.
City people and rather dull. Intensely cold coming home,
and vague reports of a fire somewhere. Frederick says
the Royal Exchange, at which I sneer most sagely;
for&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Thursday, January 11th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>To-day the papers are full of it, and it <i>was</i> the
Royal Exchange, Lloyd's, and all the shops round the
building. Called on Browne and went with him to see
the ruins, of which we saw as much as we should have
done if we had stopped at home.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Sunday, January 14th, 1838.</i><br />
</div>

<p>To church in the morning, and when I came home
I wrote the preceding portion of this diary, which henceforth
I make a steadfast resolution not to neglect, or <i>paint</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I have not done it yet, nor will I; but say what rises to my
lips&mdash;my mental lips at least&mdash;without reserve. No other
eyes will see it, while mine are open in life, and although I
daresay I shall be ashamed of a good deal in it, I should
like to look over it at the year's end.</p>

<p>In Scott's diary, which I have been looking at this
morning, there are thoughts which have been mine by
day and by night, in good spirits and bad, since Mary
died.</p>

<p>"Another day, and a bright one to the external world
again opens on us; the air soft, and the flowers smiling,
and the leaves glittering. They cannot refresh her to whom
mild weather was a natural enjoyment. Cerements of
lead and of wood already hold her; cold earth must have
her soon. But it is not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (she) who will be laid
among the ruins.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She is sentient and conscious of
my emotions <i>somewhere</i>&mdash;where, we cannot tell, how, we
cannot tell; yet would I not at this moment renounce
the mysterious yet certain hope that I shall see her in a
better world, for all that this world can give me.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>"I have seen her. There is the same symmetry of
form, though those limbs are rigid which were once so
gracefully elastic; but that yellow masque with pinched
features, which seems to mock life rather than emulate
it, can it be the face that was once so full of lively
expression? I will not look upon it again."</p>

<p>I know but too well how true all this is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<div class='date'><br /><br />
<i>Monday, January 15th, 1838.</i><br />

<p>Circumstances have enabled me to relinquish my
old connection with the "Miscellany"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> at an earlier
period than I had expected. I am no longer its editor,
but I have referred your paper to my successor, and
marked it as one "requiring attention." I have no doubt
it will receive it.</p>

<p>With reference to your letter bearing date on the 8th
of last October, let me assure you that I have delayed
answering it&mdash;not because a constant stream of similar
epistles has rendered me callous to the anxieties of a
beginner, in those doubtful paths in which I walk
myself&mdash;but because you ask me to do that which I
would scarce do, of my own unsupported opinion, for
my own child, supposing I had one old enough to require
such a service. To suppose that I could gravely take
upon myself the responsibility of withdrawing you from
pursuits you have already undertaken, or urging you on
in a most uncertain and hazardous course of life, is really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a compliment to my judgment and inflexibility which I
cannot recognize and do not deserve (or desire). I hoped
that a little reflection would show you how impossible it
is that I could be expected to enter upon a task of so much
delicacy, but as you have written to me since, and called
(unfortunately at a period when I am obliged to seclude
myself from all comers), I am compelled at last to tell you
that I can do nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>If it be any satisfaction to you to know that I have
read what you sent me, and read it with great pleasure,
though, as you treat of local matters, I am necessarily in
the dark here and there, I can give you the assurance
very sincerely. With this, and many thanks to you for
your obliging expressions towards myself,</p>

<p>The place where you pledge yourself to pay for my
beef and mutton when I eat it, and my ale and wine when
I drink it, is the Treasurer's Office of the Middle Temple,
the new building at the bottom of Middle Temple Lane
on the right-hand side. You walk up into the first-floor
and say (boldly) that you come to sign Mr. Charles
Dickens's bond&mdash;which is already signed by Mr. Sergeant
Talfourd. I suppose I should formally acquaint you that
I have paid the fees, and that the responsibility you incur
is a very slight one&mdash;extending very little beyond my
good behaviour, and honourable intentions to pay for all
wine-glasses, tumblers, or other dinner-furniture that I
may break or damage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish you would do me another service, and that is
to choose, at the place you told me of, a reasonable copy
of "The Beauties of England and Wales." You can choose
it quite as well as I can, or better, and I shall be much
obliged to you. I should like you to send it at once, as
I am diving into all kinds of matters at odd minutes with
a view to our forthcoming operations.</p>

<p>I have received a most flattering message from
the head turnkey of the jail this morning, intimating that
"there warn't a genelman in all London he'd be gladder
to show his babies to, than Muster Dickins, and let him
come wenever he would to that shop he wos welcome."
But as the Governor (who is a very nice fellow and a

postpone our visit for a day or two.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for your interesting
letter. Nor am I the less pleased to receive it, by reason
that I cannot find it in my conscience to agree in many
important respects with the body to which you belong.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p><p>In the love of virtue and hatred of vice, in the detestation

thank you for it heartily, and am proud of the approval
of one who suffered in his youth, even more than my
poor child.</p>

<p>While you teach in your walk of life the lessons of
tenderness you have learnt in sorrow, trust me that in

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Lady Blessington</span>,</div>

<p>The year goes round so fast, that when anything
occurs to remind me of its whirling, I lose my breath, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
am bewildered. So your handwriting last night had as
startling an effect upon me, as though you had sealed
your note with one of your own eyes.</p>

<p>I remember my promise, as in cheerful duty bound,
and with Heaven's grace will redeem it. At this moment,
I have not the faintest idea how, but I am going into
Scotland on the 19th to see Jeffrey, and while I am away
(I shall return, please God, in about three weeks) will look
out for some accident, incident, or subject for small
description, to send you when I come home. You will take
the will for the deed, I know; and, remembering that I
have a "Clock" which always wants winding up, will not
quarrel with me for being brief.</p>

<p>Have you seen Townshend's magnetic boy? You
heard of him, no doubt, from Count D'Orsay. If you
get him to Gore House, don't, I entreat you, have
more than eight people&mdash;four is a better number&mdash;to
see him. He fails in a crowd, and is <i>marvellous</i> before
a few.</p>

<p>I am told that down in Devonshire there are young
ladies innumerable, who read crabbed manuscripts with the
palms of their hands, and newspapers with their ankles,
and so forth; and who are, so to speak, literary all over.
I begin to understand what a blue-stocking means, and
have not the smallest doubt that Lady &mdash;&mdash; (for
instance) could write quite as entertaining a book with the
sole of her foot as ever she did with her head. I am a
believer in earnest, and I am sure you would be if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
saw this boy, under moderately favourable circumstances,
as I hope you will, before he leaves England.</p>

you have sustained, and I feel proud of your permitting
me to sympathise with your affliction. It is a great
satisfaction to me to have been addressed, under similar
circumstances, by many of your countrymen since the
"Curiosity Shop" came to a close. Some simple and
honest hearts in the remote wilds of America have written

<p>There is no man in the world who could have
given me the heartfelt pleasure you have, by your kind
note of the 13th of last month. There is no living
writer, and there are very few among the dead, whose
approbation I should feel so proud to earn. And with
everything you have written upon my shelves, and in my
thoughts, and in my heart of hearts, I may honestly and
truly say so. If you could know how earnestly I write
this, you would be glad to read it&mdash;as I hope you will
be, faintly guessing at the warmth of the hand I autobiographically
hold out to you over the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>I wish I could find in your welcome letter some hint
of an intention to visit England. I can't. I have held
it at arm's length, and taken a bird's-eye view of it, after
reading it a great many times, but there is no greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
encouragement in it this way than on a microscopic
inspection. I should love to go with you&mdash;as I have
gone, God knows how often&mdash;into Little Britain, and
Eastcheap, and Green Arbour Court, and Westminster
Abbey. I should like to travel with you, outside the last
of the coaches down to Bracebridge Hall. It would make
my heart glad to compare notes with you about that
shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat and red nose, who
sat in the nine-cornered back-parlour of the Masons'
Arms; and about Robert Preston and the tallow-chandler's
widow, whose sitting-room is second nature to me; and about
all those delightful places and people that I used to walk
about and dream of in the daytime, when a very small
and not over-particularly-taken-care-of boy. I have a
good deal to say, too, about that dashing Alonzo de
Ojeda, that you can't help being fonder of than you ought
to be; and much to hear concerning Moorish legend,
and poor unhappy Boabdil. Diedrich Knickerbocker I
have worn to death in my pocket, and yet I should show
you his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression.</p>

<p>I have been so accustomed to associate you with my
pleasantest and happiest thoughts, and with my leisure
hours, that I rush at once into full confidence with you,
and fall, as it were naturally, and by the very laws of
gravity, into your open arms. Questions come thronging
to my pen as to the lips of people who meet after long
hoping to do so. I don't know what to say first or
what to leave unsaid, and am constantly disposed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
break off and tell you again how glad I am this moment
has arrived.</p>

<p>My dear Washington Irving, I cannot thank you
enough for your cordial and generous praise, or tell you
what deep and lasting gratification it has given me. I
hope to have many letters from you, and to exchange
a frequent correspondence. I send this to say so. After
the first two or three I shall settle down into a connected
style, and become gradually rational.</p>

<p>You know what the feeling is, after having written
a letter, sealed it, and sent it off. I shall picture your
reading this, and answering it before it has lain one
night in the post-office. Ten to one that before the
fastest packet could reach New York I shall be writing
again.</p>

<p>Do you suppose the post-office clerks care to receive
letters? I have my doubts. They get into a dreadful
habit of indifference. A postman, I imagine, is quite
callous. Conceive his delivering one to himself, without
being startled by a preliminary double knock!</p>

Felton.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Fuller's Hotel, Washington</span>, <i>Monday, March 14th, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Felton</span>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></div>

<p>I was more delighted than I can possibly tell you,
to receive (last Saturday night) your welcome letter. We
and the oysters missed you terribly in New York. You
carried away with you more than half the delight and
pleasure of my New World; and I heartily wish you
could bring it back again.</p>

<p>There are very interesting men in this place&mdash;highly
interesting, of course&mdash;but it's not a comfortable place;
is it? If spittle could wait at table we should be nobly
attended, but as that property has not been imparted to
it in the present state of mechanical science, we are rather
lonely and orphan-like, in respect of "being looked arter."
A blithe black was introduced on our arrival, as our
peculiar and especial attendant. He is the only gentleman
in the town who has a peculiar delicacy in intruding upon
my valuable time. It usually takes seven rings and a
threatening message from &mdash;&mdash; to produce him; and
when he comes he goes to fetch something, and, forgetting
it by the way, comes back no more.</p>

<p>We have been in great distress, really in distress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
at the non-arrival of the <i>Caledonia</i>. You may conceive
what our joy was, when, while we were dining out yesterday,
H. arrived with the joyful intelligence of her safety.
The very news of her having really arrived seemed to
diminish the distance between ourselves and home, by one
half at least.</p>

<p>And this morning (though we have not yet received our
heap of despatches, for which we are looking eagerly
forward to this night's mail)&mdash;this morning there reached
us unexpectedly, through the Government bag (Heaven
knows how they came there!), two of our many and long-looked-for
letters, wherein was a circumstantial account of
the whole conduct and behaviour of our pets; with
marvellous narrations of Charley's precocity at a Twelfth
Night juvenile party at Macready's; and tremendous
predictions of the governess, dimly suggesting his having
got out of pot-hooks and hangers, and darkly insinuating
the possibility of his writing us a letter before long; and
many other workings of the same prophetic spirit, in
reference to him and his sisters, very gladdening to their
mother's heart, and not at all depressing to their father's.
There was, also, the doctor's report, which was a clean
bill; and the nurse's report, which was perfectly electrifying;
showing as it did how Master Walter had been
weaned, and had cut a double tooth, and done many other
extraordinary things, quite worthy of his high descent.
In short, we were made very happy and grateful; and felt
as if the prodigal father and mother had got home again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>What do you think of this incendiary card being left
at my door last night? "General G. sends compliments
to Mr. Dickens, and called with two literary ladies. As
the two L. L.'s are ambitious of the honour of a personal
introduction to Mr. D., General G. requests the honour of
an appointment for to-morrow." I draw a veil over my
sufferings. They are sacred. We shall be in Buffalo,
please Heaven, on the 30th of April. If I don't find a
letter from you in the care of the postmaster at that place,
I'll never write to you from England.</p>

<p>But if I <i>do</i> find one, my right hand shall forget its
cunning, before I forget to be your truthful and constant
correspondent; not, dear Felton, because I promised it,
nor because I have a natural tendency to correspond
(which is far from being the case), nor because I am
truly grateful to you for, and have been made truly proud
by, that affectionate and elegant tribute which &mdash;&mdash; sent me,
but because you are a man after my own heart, and I love
you <i>well</i>. And for the love I bear you, and the pleasure
with which I shall always think of you, and the glow I
shall feel when I see your handwriting in my own home,
I hereby enter into a solemn league and covenant to write
as many letters to you as you write to me, at least.
Amen.</p>

<p>Come to England! Come to England! Our oysters are
small, I know; they are said by Americans to be coppery;
but our hearts are of the largest size. We are thought
to excel in shrimps, to be far from despicable in point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of lobsters, and in periwinkles are considered to challenge
the universe. Our oysters, small though they be, are not
devoid of the refreshing influence which that species of
fish is supposed to exercise in these latitudes. Try them
and compare.</p>

Wednesday.</p>

<p>I was delighted to receive your letter yesterday,
and was well pleased with its contents. I anticipated
objection to Carlyle's<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> letter. I called particular attention
to it for three reasons. Firstly, because he boldly <i>said</i>
what all the others <i>think</i>, and therefore deserved to be
manfully supported. Secondly, because it is my deliberate
opinion that I have been assailed on this subject in a
manner in which no man with any pretensions to public
respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion
on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed
in any other country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I really cannot sufficiently thank you, dear Felton,
for your warm and hearty interest in these proceedings.
But it would be idle to pursue that theme, so let
it pass.</p>

<p>The wig and whiskers are in a state of the highest
preservation. The play comes off next Wednesday night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the 25th. What would I give to see you in the front row
of the centre box, your spectacles gleaming not unlike
those of my dear friend Pickwick, your face radiant with
as broad a grin as a staid professor may indulge in, and
your very coat, waistcoat, and shoulders expressive of what
we should take together when the performance was over!
I would give something (not so much, but still a good
round sum) if you could only stumble into that very dark
and dusty theatre in the daytime (at any minute between
twelve and three), and see me with my coat off, the stage
manager and universal director, urging impracticable
ladies and impossible gentlemen on to the very confines
of insanity, shouting and driving about, in my own person,
to an extent which would justify any philanthropic stranger
in clapping me into a strait-waistcoat without further
inquiry, endeavouring to goad H. into some dim and faint
understanding of a prompter's duties, and struggling in
such a vortex of noise, dirt, bustle, confusion, and inextricable
entanglement of speech and action as you would
grow giddy in contemplating. We perform "A Roland
for an Oliver," "A Good Night's Rest," and "Deaf as a
Post." This kind of voluntary hard labour used to be
my great delight. The <i>furor</i> has come strong upon me
again, and I begin to be once more of opinion that nature
intended me for the lessee of a national theatre, and that
pen, ink, and paper have spoiled a manager.</p>

<p>Oh, how I look forward across that rolling water to
home and its small tenantry! How I busy myself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thinking how my books look, and where the tables are,
and in what positions the chairs stand relatively to the
other furniture; and whether we shall get there in the
night, or in the morning, or in the afternoon; and whether
we shall be able to surprise them, or whether they will
be too sharply looking out for us; and what our pets
will say; and how they'll look, and who will be the first
to come and shake hands, and so forth! If I could but
tell you how I have set my heart on rushing into Forster's
study (he is my great friend, and writes at the bottom
of all his letters: "My love to Felton"), and into Maclise's
painting-room, and into Macready's managerial ditto,
without a moment's warning, and how I picture every
little trait and circumstance of our arrival to myself, down
to the very colour of the bow on the cook's cap, you
would almost think I had changed places with my eldest
son, and was still in pantaloons of the thinnest texture.
I left all these things&mdash;God only knows what a love I
have for them&mdash;as coolly and calmly as any animated
cucumber; but when I come upon them again I shall
have lost all power of self-restraint, and shall as certainly
make a fool of myself (in the popular meaning of that
expression) as ever Grimaldi did in his way, or George
the Third in his.</p>

<p>And not the less so, dear Felton, for having found
some warm hearts, and left some instalments of earnest
and sincere affection, behind me on this continent. And
whenever I turn my mental telescope hitherward, trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear
spectacles so like yours that the maker couldn't tell the
difference, and shall address a Greek class in such an
exact imitation of your voice, that the very students
hearing it should cry, "That's he! Three cheers.
Hoo-ray-ay-ay-ay-ay!"</p>

<p>About those joints of yours, I think you are mistaken.
They <i>can't</i> be stiff. At the worst they merely want the
air of New York, which, being impregnated with the
flavour of last year's oysters, has a surprising effect in
rendering the human frame supple and flexible in all
cases of rust.</p>

<p>A terrible idea occurred to me as I wrote those
words. The oyster-cellars&mdash;what do they do when oysters
are not in season? Is pickled salmon vended there? Do
they sell crabs, shrimps, winkles, herrings? The oyster-openers&mdash;what
do <i>they</i> do? Do they commit suicide in
despair, or wrench open tight drawers and cupboards and
hermetically-sealed bottles for practice? Perhaps they are
dentists out of the oyster season. Who knows?</p>

<div class='sig'>
Affectionately yours.

<span style="margin-right: 2em;">1, <span class="smcap">Devonshire Terrace, York Gate, Regent's Park</span>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>Sunday, July 31st, 1842.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Felton</span>,</div>

<p>Of all the monstrous and incalculable amount of
occupation that ever beset one unfortunate man, mine
has been the most stupendous since I came home. The
dinners I have had to eat, the places I have had to go
to, the letters I have had to answer, the sea of business
and of pleasure in which I have been plunged, not
even the genius of an &mdash;&mdash; or the pen of a &mdash;&mdash; could
describe.</p>

<p>Wherefore I indite a monstrously short and wildly uninteresting
epistle to the American Dando; but perhaps
you don't know who Dando was. He was an oyster-eater,
my dear Felton. He used to go into oyster-shops,
without a farthing of money, and stand at the
counter eating natives, until the man who opened them
grew pale, cast down his knife, staggered backward,
struck his white forehead with his open hand, and
cried, "You are Dando!!!" He has been known to
eat twenty dozen at one sitting, and would have eaten
forty, if the truth had not flashed upon the shopkeeper.
For these offences he was constantly committed
to the House of Correction. During his last imprisonment
he was taken ill, got worse and worse, and at last began
knocking violent double knocks at Death's door. The
doctor stood beside his bed, with his fingers on his pulse.
"He is going," says the doctor. "I see it in his eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
There is only one thing that would keep life in him
for another hour, and that is&mdash;oysters." They were
immediately brought. Dando swallowed eight, and feebly
took a ninth. He held it in his mouth and looked round
the bed strangely. "Not a bad one, is it?" says the
doctor. The patient shook his head, rubbed his trembling
hand upon his stomach, bolted the oyster, and fell back&mdash;dead.
They buried him in the prison-yard, and paved
his grave with oyster-shells.</p>

<p>We are all well and hearty, and have already begun
to wonder what time next year you and Mrs. Felton and
Dr. Howe will come across the briny sea together. To-morrow
we go to the seaside for two months. I am looking
out for news of Longfellow, and shall be delighted when
I know that he is on his way to London and this house.</p>

<p>I am bent upon striking at the piratical newspapers
with the sharpest edge I can put upon my small axe, and
hope in the next session of Parliament to stop their
entrance into Canada. For the first time within the
memory of man, the professors of English literature seem
disposed to act together on this question. It is a good
thing to aggravate a scoundrel, if one can do nothing
else, and I think we <i>can</i> make them smart a little in
this way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I wish you had been at Greenwich the other day, where
a party of friends gave me a private dinner; public ones
I have refused. C&mdash;&mdash; was perfectly wild at the reunion,
and, after singing all manner of marine songs, wound up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the entertainment by coming home (six miles) in a little
open phaeton of mine, <i>on his head</i>, to the mingled delight
and indignation of the metropolitan police. We were
very jovial indeed; and I assure you that I drank your
health with fearful vigour and energy.</p>

<p>On board that ship coming home I established a club,
called the United Vagabonds, to the large amusement of
the rest of the passengers. This holy brotherhood committed
all kinds of absurdities, and dined always, with a
variety of solemn forms, at one end of the table, below the
mast, away from all the rest. The captain being ill when
we were three or four days out, I produced my medicine-chest
and recovered him. We had a few more sick men
after that, and I went round "the wards" every day in
great state, accompanied by two Vagabonds, habited as
Ben Allen and Bob Sawyer, bearing enormous rolls of
plaster and huge pairs of scissors. We were really very
merry all the way, breakfasted in one party at Liverpool,
shook hands, and parted most cordially.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Affectionately your faithful friend.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have looked over my journal, and have decided
to produce my American trip in two volumes. I have
written about half the first since I came home, and hope
to be out in October. This is "exclusive news," to be
communicated to any friends to whom you may like to
intrust it, my dear F&mdash;&mdash;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course that letter in the papers was as foul a
forgery as ever felon swung for.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have not contradicted
it publicly, nor shall I. When I tilt at such wringings out
of the dirtiest mortality, I shall be another man&mdash;indeed,
almost the creature they would make me.</p>

<p>I gave your message to Forster, who sends a despatch-box
full of kind remembrances in return. He is in a
great state of delight with the first volume of my American
book (which I have just finished), and swears loudly by
it. It is <i>True</i> and Honourable I know, and I shall hope
to send it you, complete, by the first steamer in November.</p>

<p>Your description of the porter and the carpet-bags
prepares me for a first-rate facetious novel, brimful of

engaged. What is it called? Sometimes I imagine the

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the man putting the luggage on his head, as
a sort of sign, I adopt it from this hour.</p>

<p>I date this from London, where I have come, as a good
profligate, graceless bachelor, for a day or two; leaving
my wife and babbies at the seaside.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Heavens! if you
were but here at this minute! A piece of salmon and
a steak are cooking in the kitchen; it's a very wet day,
and I have had a fire lighted; the wine sparkles on a side
table; the room looks the more snug from being the
only <i>un</i>dismantled one in the house; plates are warming
for Forster and Maclise, whose knock I am momentarily
expecting; that groom I told you of, who never comes
into the house, except when we are all out of town, is
walking about in his shirt-sleeves without the smallest
consciousness of impropriety; a great mound of proofs
are waiting to be read aloud, after dinner. With what
a shout I would clap you down into the easiest chair,
my genial Felton, if you could but appear, and order you
a pair of slippers instantly!</p>

<p>Since I have written this, the aforesaid groom&mdash;a
very small man (as the fashion is), with fiery red hair
(as the fashion is <i>not</i>)&mdash;has looked very hard at me and
fluttered about me at the same time, like a giant butterfly.
After a pause, he says, in a Sam Wellerish kind of way:
"I vent to the club this mornin', sir. There vorn't no
letters, sir." "Very good, Topping." "How's missis,
sir?" "Pretty well, Topping." "Glad to hear it, sir.
<i>My</i> missis ain't wery well, sir." "No!" "No, sir, she's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a goin', sir, to have a hincrease wery soon, and it makes
her rather nervous, sir; and ven a young voman gets
at all down at sich a time, sir, she goes down wery deep,
sir." To this sentiment I replied affirmatively, and then
he adds, as he stirs the fire (as if he were thinking out
loud): "Wot a mystery it is! Wot a go is natur'!"
With which scrap of philosophy, he gradually gets nearer
to the door, and so fades out of the room.</p>

<p>This same man asked me one day, soon after I came
home, what Sir John Wilson was. This is a friend of
mine, who took our house and servants, and everything
as it stood, during our absence in America. I told him
an officer. "A wot, sir?" "An officer." And then,
for fear he should think I meant a police-officer, I added,
"An officer in the army." "I beg your pardon, sir,"
he said, touching his hat, "but the club as I always drove
him to wos the United Servants."</p>

<p>The real name of this club is the United Service, but
I have no doubt he thought it was a high-life-below-stairs
kind of resort, and that this gentleman was a retired
butler or superannuated footman.</p>

<p>There's the knock, and the Great Western sails, or
steams rather, to-morrow. Write soon again, dear Felton,
and ever believe me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<p>P.S.&mdash;All good angels prosper Dr. Howe! He, at

<p>Many and many happy New Years to you and
yours! As many happy children as may be quite convenient
(no more!), and as many happy meetings between
them and our children, and between you and us, as the
kind fates in their utmost kindness shall favourably
decree!</p>

<p>The American book (to begin with that) has been a
most complete and thorough-going success. Four large
editions have now been sold <i>and paid for</i>, and it has
won golden opinions from all sorts of men, except our
friend in F&mdash;&mdash;, who is a miserable creature; a disappointed
man in great poverty, to whom I have ever
been most kind and considerate (I need scarcely say that);
and another friend in B&mdash;&mdash;, no less a person than an
illustrious gentleman named &mdash;&mdash;, who wrote a story called
&mdash;&mdash;. They have done no harm, and have fallen short
of their mark, which, of course, was to annoy me. Now
I am perfectly free from any diseased curiosity in such
respects, and whenever I hear of a notice of this kind,
I never read it; whereby I always conceive (don't you?)
that I get the victory. With regard to your slave-owners,
they may cry, till they are as black in the face
as their own slaves, that Dickens lies. Dickens does not
write for their satisfaction, and Dickens will not explain
for their comfort. Dickens has the name and date of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
every newspaper in which every one of those advertisements
appeared, as they know perfectly well; but Dickens
does not choose to give them, and will not at any time
between this and the day of judgment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I have been hard at work on my new book, of which
the first number has just appeared. The Paul Joneses
who pursue happiness and profit at other men's cost will
no doubt enable you to read it, almost as soon as you
receive this. I hope you will like it. And I particularly
commend, my dear Felton, one Mr. Pecksniff and his
daughters to your tender regards. I have a kind of
liking for them myself.</p>

<p>Blessed star of morning, such a trip as we had
into Cornwall, just after Longfellow went away! The
"we" means Forster, Maclise, Stanfield (the renowned
marine painter), and the Inimitable Boz. We went
down into Devonshire by the railroad, and there we hired
an open carriage from an innkeeper, patriotic in all
Pickwick matters, and went on with post-horses. Sometimes
we travelled all night, sometimes all day, sometimes
both. I kept the joint-stock purse, ordered all the
dinners, paid all the turnpikes, conducted facetious conversations
with the post-boys, and regulated the pace at
which we travelled. Stanfield (an old sailor) consulted
an enormous map on all disputed points of wayfaring;
and referred, moreover, to a pocket-compass and other
scientific instruments. The luggage was in Forster's
department; and Maclise, having nothing particular to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
do, sang songs. Heavens! If you could have seen the
necks of bottles&mdash;distracting in their immense varieties
of shape&mdash;peering out of the carriage pockets! If you
could have witnessed the deep devotion of the post-boys,
the wild attachment of the hostlers, the maniac glee of
the waiters! If you could have followed us into the
earthy old churches we visited, and into the strange
caverns on the gloomy sea-shore, and down into the depths
of mines, and up to the tops of giddy heights where
the unspeakably green water was roaring, I don't know
how many hundred feet below! If you could have seen
but one gleam of the bright fires by which we sat in
the big rooms of ancient inns at night, until long after
the small hours had come and gone, or smelt but one
steam of the hot punch (not white, dear Felton, like that
amazing compound I sent you a taste of, but a rich,
genial, glowing brown) which came in every evening in
a huge broad china bowl! I never laughed in my life
as I did on this journey. It would have done you good
to hear me. I was choking and gasping and bursting
the buckle off the back of my stock, all the way. And
Stanfield (who is very much of your figure and temperament,
but fifteen years older) got into such apoplectic
entanglements that we were often obliged to beat him
on the back with portmanteaus before we could recover
him. Seriously, I do believe there never was such a
trip. And they made such sketches, those two men, in
the most romantic of our halting-places, that you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have sworn we had the Spirit of Beauty with us, as well
as the Spirit of Fun. But stop till you come to England&mdash;I
say no more.</p>

<p>The actuary of the national debt couldn't calculate
the number of children who are coming here on
Twelfth Night, in honour of Charley's birthday, for which
occasion I have provided a magic lantern and divers
other tremendous engines of that nature. But the best
of it is that Forster and I have purchased between us
the entire stock-in-trade of a conjurer, the practice and
display whereof is intrusted to me. And O my dear eyes,
Felton, if you could see me conjuring the company's
watches into impossible tea-caddies, and causing pieces
of money to fly, and burning pocket-handkerchiefs without
hurting 'em, and practising in my own room, without
anybody to admire, you would never forget it as long
as you live. In those tricks which require a confederate,
I am assisted (by reason of his imperturbable good humour)
by Stanfield, who always does his part exactly the wrong
way, to the unspeakable delight of all beholders. We
come out on a small scale, to-night, at Forster's, where
we see the old year out and the new one in. Particulars
shall be forwarded in my next.</p>

<p>I have quite made up my mind that F&mdash;&mdash; really
believes he <i>does</i> know you personally, and has all his
life. He talks to me about you with such gravity that
I am afraid to grin, and feel it necessary to look quite
serious. Sometimes he <i>tells</i> me things about you, doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ask me, you know, so that I am occasionally perplexed
beyond all telling, and begin to think it was he, and
not I, who went to America. It's the queerest thing in
the world.</p>

<p>The book I was to have given Longfellow for you
is not worth sending by itself, being only a Barnaby.
But I will look up some manuscript for you (I think I
have that of the American Notes complete), and will
try to make the parcel better worth its long conveyance.
With regard to Maclise's pictures, you certainly are
quite right in your impression of them; but he is "such
a discursive devil" (as he says about himself) and flies
off at such odd tangents, that I feel it difficult to convey
to you any general notion of his purpose. I will try to
do so when I write again. I want very much to know
about &mdash;&mdash; and that charming girl.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Give me full
particulars. Will you remember me cordially to Sumner,
and say I thank him for his welcome letter? The like
to Hillard, with many regards to himself and his wife,
with whom I had one night a little conversation which I
shall not readily forget. The like to Washington Allston,
and all friends who care for me and have outlived my
book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Always, my dear Felton,</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>Let me hasten to say, in the fullest and most
explicit manner, that you have acted a most honourable,
open, fair and manly part in the matter of my complaint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
for which I beg you to accept my best thanks, and the
assurance of my friendship and regard. I would on no
account publish the letter you have sent me for that
purpose, as I conceive that by doing so, I should not
reciprocate the spirit in which you have written to me
privately. But if you should, upon consideration, think
it not inexpedient to set the <i>Review</i> right in regard
to this point of fact, by a note in the next number, I
should be glad to see it there.</p>

<p>In reference to the article itself, it did, by repeating
this statement, hurt my feelings excessively; and is, in
this respect, I still conceive, most unworthy of its author.
I am at a loss to divine who its author is. I <i>know</i> he
read in some cut-throat American paper, this and other
monstrous statements, which I could at any time have
converted into sickening praise by the payment of some
fifty dollars. I know that he is perfectly aware that
his statement in the <i>Review</i> in corroboration of these
lies, would be disseminated through the whole of the
United States; and that my contradiction will never be
heard of. And though I care very little for the opinion
of any person who will set the statement of an American
editor (almost invariably an atrocious scoundrel) against
my character and conduct, such as they may be; still,
my sense of justice does revolt from this most cavalier and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
careless exhibition of me to a whole people, as a traveller
under false pretences, and a disappointed intriguer. The
better the acquaintance with America, the more defenceless
and more inexcusable such conduct is. For, I solemnly
declare (and appeal to any man but the writer of this
paper, who has travelled in that country, for confirmation
of my statement) that the source from which he drew
the "information" so recklessly put forth again in
England, is infinitely more obscene, disgusting, and brutal
than the very worst Sunday newspaper that has ever
been printed in Great Britain. Conceive <i>The Edinburgh
Review</i> quoting <i>The Satirist</i>, or <i>The Man about Town</i>,
as an authority against a man with one grain of honour,
or feather-weight of reputation.</p>

<p>With regard to yourself, let me say again that I thank
you with all sincerity and heartiness, and fully acquit
you of anything but kind and generous intentions towards
me. In proof of which, I do assure you that I am even
more desirous than before to write for the <i>Review</i>, and
to find some topic which would at once please me and
you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Always faithfully yours.

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Felton</span>,</div>

<p>I don't know where to begin, but plunge headlong
with a terrible splash into this letter, on the chance
of turning up somewhere.</p>

<p>Hurrah! Up like a cork again, with <i>The North
American Review</i> in my hand. Like you, my dear
&mdash;&mdash;, and I can say no more in praise of it, though I
go on to the end of the sheet. You cannot think how
much notice it has attracted here. Brougham called the
other day, with the number (thinking I might not have
seen it), and I being out at the time, he left a note,
speaking of it, and of the writer, in terms that warmed
my heart. Lord Ashburton (one of whose people wrote
a notice in the <i>Edinburgh</i> which they have since
publicly contradicted) also wrote to me about it in just
the same strain. And many others have done the like.</p>

<p>I am in great health and spirits and powdering away
at Chuzzlewit, with all manner of facetiousness rising up
before me as I go on. As to news, I have really none,
saving that &mdash;&mdash; (who never took any exercise in his
life) has been laid up with rheumatism for weeks past,
but is now, I hope, getting better. My little captain, as
I call him&mdash;he who took me out, I mean, and with
whom I had that adventure of the cork soles&mdash;has
been in London too, and seeing all the lions under my
escort. Good heavens! I wish you could have seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
certain other mahogany-faced men (also captains) who
used to call here for him in the morning, and bear him
off to docks and rivers and all sorts of queer places,
whence he always returned late at night, with rum-and-water
tear-drops in his eyes, and a complication of
punchy smells in his mouth! He was better than a
comedy to us, having marvellous ways of tying his
pocket-handkerchief round his neck at dinner-time in a
kind of jolly embarrassment, and then forgetting what
he had done with it; also of singing songs to wrong
tunes, and calling land objects by sea names, and never
knowing what o'clock it was, but taking midnight for
seven in the evening; with many other sailor oddities,
all full of honesty, manliness, and good temper. We
took him to Drury Lane Theatre to see "Much Ado
About Nothing." But I never could find out what he
meant by turning round, after he had watched the first
two scenes with great attention, and inquiring "whether
it was a Polish piece." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April I am going to preside at a public
dinner for the benefit of the printers; and if you were
a guest at that table, wouldn't I smite you on the
shoulder, harder than ever I rapped the well-beloved
back of Washington Irving at the City Hotel in New
York!</p>

<p>You were asking me&mdash;I love to say asking, as if we
could talk together&mdash;about Maclise. He is such a discursive
fellow, and so eccentric in his might, that on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mental review of his pictures I can hardly tell you of
them as leading to any one strong purpose. But the
annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy comes off in
May, and then I will endeavour to give you some notion
of him. He is a tremendous creature, and might do
anything. But, like all tremendous creatures, he takes
his own way, and flies off at unexpected breaches in the
conventional wall.</p>

<p>You know H&mdash;&mdash;'s Book, I daresay. Ah! I saw a
scene of mingled comicality and seriousness at his funeral
some weeks ago, which has choked me at dinner-time
ever since. C&mdash;&mdash; and I went as mourners; and as he
lived, poor fellow, five miles out of town, I drove C&mdash;&mdash;
down. It was such a day as I hope, for the credit of
nature, is seldom seen in any parts but these&mdash;muddy,
foggy, wet, dark, cold, and unutterably wretched in
every possible respect. Now, C&mdash;&mdash; has enormous
whiskers, which straggle all down his throat in such
weather, and stick out in front of him, like a partially
unravelled bird's-nest; so that he looks queer enough at
the best, but when he is very wet, and in a state
between jollity (he is always very jolly with me) and
the deepest gravity (going to a funeral, you know), it is
utterly impossible to resist him; especially as he makes
the strangest remarks the mind of man can conceive,
without any intention of being funny, but rather meaning
to be philosophical. I really cried with an irresistible
sense of his comicality all the way; but when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
dressed out in a black cloak and a very long black hat-band
by an undertaker (who, as he whispered me with
tears in his eyes&mdash;for he had known H&mdash;&mdash; many years&mdash;was
a "character, and he would like to sketch him"),
I thought I should have been obliged to go away.
However, we went into a little parlour where the funeral
party was, and God knows it was miserable enough,
for the widow and children were crying bitterly in one
corner, and the other mourners&mdash;mere people of ceremony,
who cared no more for the dead man than the hearse
did&mdash;were talking quite coolly and carelessly together in
another; and the contrast was as painful and distressing
as anything I ever saw. There was an Independent
clergyman present, with his bands on and a bible under
his arm, who, as soon as we were seated, addressed &mdash;&mdash;
thus, in a loud emphatic voice: "Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, have you
seen a paragraph respecting our departed friend, which
has gone the round of the morning papers?" "Yes,
sir," says C&mdash;&mdash;, "I have," looking very hard at me the
while, for he had told me with some pride coming down
that it was his composition. "Oh!" said the clergyman.
"Then you will agree with me, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, that it is not
only an insult to me, who am the servant of the Almighty,
but an insult to the Almighty, whose servant I am."
"How is that, sir?" said C&mdash;&mdash;. "It is stated, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;,
in that paragraph," says the minister, "that when Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; failed in business as a bookseller, he was persuaded
by <i>me</i> to try the pulpit; which is false, incorrect, unchristian,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in a manner blasphemous, and in all respects
contemptible. Let us pray." With which, my dear
Felton, and in the same breath, I give you my word, he
knelt down, as we all did, and began a very miserable
jumble of an extemporary prayer. I was really penetrated
with sorrow for the family, but when C&mdash;&mdash; (upon his
knees, and sobbing for the loss of an old friend) whispered
me, "that if that wasn't a clergyman, and it wasn't a
funeral, he'd have punched his head," I felt as if nothing
but convulsions could possibly relieve me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Hogarth</span>,</div>

<p>I was dressing to go to church yesterday morning&mdash;thinking,
very sadly, of that time six years&mdash;when your
kind note and its accompanying packet were brought to
me. The best portrait that was ever painted would be
of little value to you and me, in comparison with that
unfading picture we have within us; and of the worst
(which &mdash;&mdash;'s really is) I can only say, that it has no
interest in my eyes, beyond being something which she
sat near in its progress, full of life and beauty. In that
light, I set some store by the copy you have sent me;
and as a mark of your affection, I need not say I value it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
very much. As any record of that dear face, it is utterly
worthless.</p>

<p>I trace in many respects a strong resemblance between
her mental features and Georgina's&mdash;so strange a one, at
times, that when she and Kate and I are sitting together,
I seem to think that what has happened is a melancholy
dream from which I am just awakening. The perfect
like of what she was, will never be again, but so much
of her spirit shines out in this sister, that the old time
comes back again at some seasons, and I can hardly
separate it from the present.</p>

<p>After she died, I dreamed of her every night for many
months&mdash;I think for the better part of a year&mdash;sometimes
as a spirit, sometimes as a living creature, never
with any of the bitterness of my real sorrow, but
always with a kind of quiet happiness, which became
so pleasant to me that I never lay down at night
without a hope of the vision coming back in one
shape or other. And so it did. I went down into Yorkshire,
and finding it still present to me, in a strange
scene and a strange bed, I could not help mentioning
the circumstance in a note I wrote home to Kate. From
that moment I have never dreamed of her once, though
she is so much in my thoughts at all times (especially
when I am successful, and have prospered in anything)
that the recollection of her is an essential part of my
being, and is as inseparable from my existence as the
beating of my heart is.</p>

Always affectionately.

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Broadstairs, Kent</span>, <i>September 1st, 1843.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Felton</span>,</div>

<p>If I thought it in the nature of things that you
and I could ever agree on paper, touching a certain
Chuzzlewitian question whereupon F&mdash;&mdash; tells me you
have remarks to make, I should immediately walk into
the same, tooth and nail. But as I don't, I won't.
Contenting myself with this prediction, that one of these
years and days, you will write or say to me: "My dear
Dickens, you were right, though rough, and did a world
of good, though you got most thoroughly hated for it."
To which I shall reply: "My dear Felton, I looked a
long way off and not immediately under my nose." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
At which sentiment you will laugh, and I shall laugh;
and then (for I foresee this will all happen in my land)
we shall call for another pot of porter and two or three
dozen of oysters.</p>

<p>Now, don't you in your own heart and soul quarrel
with me for this long silence? Not half so much as I
quarrel with myself, I know; but if you could read
half the letters I write to you in imagination, you would
swear by me for the best of correspondents. The truth
is, that when I have done my morning's work, down goes
my pen, and from that minute I feel it a positive impossibility
to take it up again, until imaginary butchers
and bakers wave me to my desk. I walk about brimful
of letters, facetious descriptions, touching morsels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pathetic friendships, but can't for the soul of me uncork
myself. The post-office is my rock ahead. My average
number of letters that <i>must</i> be written every day is, at
the least, a dozen. And you could no more know what
I was writing to you spiritually, from the perusal of the
bodily thirteenth, than you could tell from my hat what
was going on in my head, or could read my heart on
the surface of my flannel waistcoat.</p>

<p>This is a little fishing-place; intensely quiet; built
on a cliff, whereon&mdash;in the centre of a tiny semicircular
bay&mdash;our house stands; the sea rolling and dashing under
the windows. Seven miles out are the Goodwin Sands
(you've heard of the Goodwin Sands?) whence floating
lights perpetually wink after dark, as if they were carrying
on intrigues with the servants. Also there is a big
lighthouse called the North Foreland on a hill behind
the village, a severe parsonic light, which reproves the
young and giddy floaters, and stares grimly out upon
the sea. Under the cliff are rare good sands, where all
the children assemble every morning and throw up
impossible fortifications, which the sea throws down again
at high water. Old gentlemen and ancient ladies flirt
after their own manner in two reading-rooms and on a
great many scattered seats in the open air. Other old
gentlemen look all day through telescopes and never see
anything. In a bay-window in a one-pair sits, from nine
o'clock to one, a gentleman with rather long hair and no
neckcloth, who writes and grins as if he thought he were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
very funny indeed. His name is Boz. At one he disappears,
and presently emerges from a bathing-machine,
and may be seen&mdash;a kind of salmon-coloured porpoise&mdash;splashing
about in the ocean. After that he may be
seen in another bay-window on the ground-floor, eating
a strong lunch; after that, walking a dozen miles or so,
or lying on his back in the sand reading a book. Nobody
bothers him unless they know he is disposed to be talked
to; and I am told he is very comfortable indeed. He's
as brown as a berry, and they <i>do</i> say is a small fortune
to the innkeeper who sells beer and cold punch. But
this is mere rumour. Sometimes he goes up to London
(eighty miles, or so, away), and then I'm told there is
a sound in Lincoln's Inn Fields at night, as of men laughing,
together with a clinking of knives and forks and
wine-glasses.</p>

<p>I never shall have been so near you since we parted
aboard the <i>George Washington</i> as next Tuesday. Forster,
Maclise, and I, and perhaps Stanfield, are then going
aboard the Cunard steamer at Liverpool, to bid Macready
good-bye, and bring his wife away. It will be a very
hard parting. You will see and know him of course.
We gave him a splendid dinner last Saturday at Richmond,
whereat I presided with my accustomed grace. He is
one of the noblest fellows in the world, and I would
give a great deal that you and I should sit beside each
other to see him play Virginius, Lear, or Werner, which
I take to be, every way, the greatest piece of exquisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
perfection that his lofty art is capable of attaining. His
Macbeth, especially the last act, is a tremendous reality;
but so indeed is almost everything he does. You recollect,
perhaps, that he was the guardian of our children while
we were away. I love him dearly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>You asked me, long ago, about Maclise. He is such
a wayward fellow in his subjects, that it would be next
to impossible to write such an article as you were thinking
of about him. I wish you could form an idea of his
genius. One of these days a book will come out, "Moore's
Irish Melodies," entirely illustrated by him, on every page.
<i>When</i> it comes, I'll send it to you. You will have some
notion of him then. He is in great favour with the
Queen, and paints secret pictures for her to put upon
her husband's table on the morning of his birthday, and
the like. But if he has a care, he will leave his mark on
more enduring things than palace walls.</p>

<p>And so L&mdash;&mdash; is married. I remember <i>her</i> well, and
could draw her portrait, in words, to the life. A very
beautiful and gentle creature, and a proper love for a
poet. My cordial remembrances and congratulations. Do
they live in the house where we breakfasted?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I very often dream I am in America again; but,
strange to say, I never dream of you. I am always
endeavouring to get home in disguise, and have a
dreary sense of the distance. <i>&Agrave; propos</i> of dreams, is it
not a strange thing if writers of fiction never dream of
their own creations; recollecting, I suppose, even in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
dreams, that they have no real existence? <i>I</i> never
dreamed of any of my own characters, and I feel it so
impossible that I would wager Scott never did of his,
real as they are. I had a good piece of absurdity in
my head a night or two ago. I dreamed that somebody
was dead. I don't know who, but it's not to the purpose.
It was a private gentleman, and a particular friend; and
I was greatly overcome when the news was broken to
me (very delicately) by a gentleman in a cocked hat, top
boots, and a sheet. Nothing else. "Good God!" I said,
"is he dead?" "He is as dead, sir," rejoined the gentleman,
"as a door-nail. But we must all die, Mr. Dickens,
sooner or later, my dear sir." "Ah!" I said. "Yes,
to be sure. Very true. But what did he die of?" The
gentleman burst into a flood of tears, and said, in a voice
broken by emotion: "He christened his youngest child,
sir, with a toasting-fork." I never in my life was so
affected as at his having fallen a victim to this complaint.
It carried a conviction to my mind that he never could
have recovered. I knew that it was the most interesting
and fatal malady in the world; and I wrung the gentleman's
hand in a convulsion of respectful admiration, for
I felt that this explanation did equal honour to his head
and heart!</p>

<p>What do you think of Mrs. Gamp? And how do you
like the undertaker? I have a fancy that they are in
your way. Oh heaven! such green woods as I was
rambling among down in Yorkshire, when I was getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that done last July! For days and weeks we never
saw the sky but through green boughs; and all day long
I cantered over such soft moss and turf, that the horse's
feet scarcely made a sound upon it. We have some friends
in that part of the country (close to Castle Howard, where
Lord Morpeth's father dwells in state, <i>in</i> his park indeed),
who are the jolliest of the jolly, keeping a big old country
house, with an ale cellar something larger than a reasonable
church, and everything, like Goldsmith's bear dances,
"in a concatenation accordingly." Just the place for
you, Felton! We performed some madnesses there in
the way of forfeits, picnics, rustic games, inspections of
ancient monasteries at midnight, when the moon was
shining, that would have gone to your heart, and, as
Mr. Weller says, "come out on the other side." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Write soon, my dear Felton; and if I write to you
less often than I would, believe that my affectionate heart
is with you always. Loves and regards to all friends,
from yours ever and ever.</p>

<p>I hinted, in a letter of introduction I gave Mr.
Hood to you, that I had been thinking of a subject for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>the <i>Edinburgh</i>. Would it meet the purposes of the
<i>Review</i> to come out strongly against any system of education
based exclusively on the principles of the Established
Church? If it would, I should like to show why such
a thing as the Church Catechism is wholly inapplicable
to the state of ignorance that now prevails; and why no
system but one, so general in great religious principles
as to include all creeds, can meet the wants and understandings
of the dangerous classes of society. This is
the only broad ground I could hold, consistently with
what I feel and think on such a subject. But I could
give, in taking it, a description of certain voluntary
places of instruction, called "the ragged schools," now
existing in London, and of the schools in jails, and of
the ignorance presented in such places, which would
make a very striking paper, especially if they were put
in strong comparison with the effort making, by subscription,
to maintain exclusive Church instruction. I
could show these people in a state so miserable and so
neglected, that their very nature rebels against the
simplest religion, and that to convey to them the faintest
outlines of any system of distinction between right and
wrong is in itself a giant's task, before which mysteries
and squabbles for forms <i>must</i> give way. Would this be
too much for the <i>Review?</i></p>

Felton.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Devonshire Terrace, London</span>, <i>January 2nd, 1844.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My very dear Felton</span>,</div>

<p>You are a prophet, and had best retire from
business straightway. Yesterday morning, New Year's
Day, when I walked into my little workroom after breakfast,
and was looking out of window at the snow in
the garden&mdash;not seeing it particularly well in consequence
of some staggering suggestions of last night, whereby
I was beset&mdash;the postman came to the door with a knock,
for which I denounced him from my heart. Seeing your
hand upon the cover of a letter which he brought, I
immediately blessed him, presented him with a glass of
whisky, inquired after his family (they are all well),
and opened the despatch with a moist and oystery
twinkle in my eye. And on the very day from which
the new year dates, I read your New Year congratulations
as punctually as if you lived in the next house. Why
don't you?</p>

<p>Now, if instantly on the receipt of this you will send
a free and independent citizen down to the Cunard wharf
at Boston, you will find that Captain Hewett, of the
<i>Britannia</i> steamship (my ship), has a small parcel for
Professor Felton of Cambridge; and in that parcel you
will find a Christmas Carol in prose; being a short story
of Christmas by Charles Dickens. Over which Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Carol Charles Dickens wept and laughed and wept again,
and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner in
the composition; and thinking whereof he walked about
the black streets of London, fifteen and twenty miles
many a night when all the sober folks had gone
to bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Its success is most prodigious. And by
every post all manner of strangers write all manner of
letters to him about their homes and hearths, and how
this same Carol is read aloud there, and kept on a little
shelf by itself. Indeed, it is the greatest success, as I
am told, that this ruffian and rascal has ever achieved.</p>

<p>Forster is out again; and if he don't go in again,
after the manner in which we have been keeping Christmas,
he must be very strong indeed. Such dinings, such
dancings, such conjurings, such blindman's-buffings, such
theatre-goings, such kissings-out of old years and kissings-in
of new ones, never took place in these parts before.
To keep the Chuzzlewit going, and do this little book,
the Carol, in the odd times between two parts of it, was,
as you may suppose, pretty tight work. But when it
was done I broke out like a madman. And if you could
have seen me at a children's party at Macready's the
other night, going down a country dance with Mrs. M.,
you would have thought I was a country gentleman
of independent property, residing on a tiptop farm, with
the wind blowing straight in my face every day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Your friend, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, dined with us one day (I
don't know whether I told you this before), and pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
us very much. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; has dined here once, and
spent an evening here. I have not seen him lately,
though he has called twice or thrice; for K&mdash;&mdash; being
unwell and I busy, we have not been visible at our
accustomed seasons. I wonder whether H&mdash;&mdash; has fallen
in your way. Poor H&mdash;&mdash;! He was a good fellow, and
has the most grateful heart I ever met with. Our
journeyings seem to be a dream now. Talking of dreams,
strange thoughts of Italy and France, and maybe Germany,
are springing up within me as the Chuzzlewit clears off.
It's a secret I have hardly breathed to anyone, but I
"think" of leaving England for a year, next midsummer,
bag and baggage, little ones and all&mdash;then coming out
with <i>such</i> a story, Felton, all at once, no parts, sledgehammer
blow.</p>

<p>I send you a Manchester paper, as you desire. The
report is not exactly done, but very well done, notwithstanding.
It was a very splendid sight, I assure you,
and an awful-looking audience. I am going to preside
at a similar meeting at Liverpool on the 26th of next
month, and on my way home I may be obliged to preside
at another at Birmingham. I will send you papers, if
the reports be at all like the real thing.</p>

<p>I wrote to Prescott about his book, with which I
was perfectly charmed. I think his descriptions masterly,
his style brilliant, his purpose manly and gallant always.
The introductory account of Aztec civilisation impressed
me exactly as it impressed you. From beginning to end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the whole history is enchanting and full of genius. I
only wonder that, having such an opportunity of illustrating
the doctrine of visible judgments, he never remarks, when
Cortes and his men tumble the idols down the temple
steps and call upon the people to take notice that their
gods are powerless to help themselves, that possibly if
some intelligent native had tumbled down the image
of the Virgin or patron saint after them nothing very
remarkable might have ensued in consequence.</p>

<p>Of course you like Macready. Your name's Felton.
I wish you could see him play Lear. It is stupendously
terrible. But I suppose he would be slow to act it with
the Boston company.</p>

<p>Hearty remembrances to Sumner, Longfellow, Prescott,
and all whom you know I love to remember. Countless
happy years to you and yours, my dear Felton, and some
instalment of them, however slight, in England, in the
loving company of</p>

<p>Pray do not believe that the least intentional neglect

not be displeasing to you.</p>

<p>At the time when you called, and for many weeks
afterwards, I was so closely occupied with my little

I never left home before the owls went out, and led
quite a solitary life. When I began to have a little time
and to go abroad again, I knew that you were in affliction,
and I then thought it better to wait, even before I left
a card at your door, until the pressure of your distress
had past.</p>

<p>I fancy a reproachful spirit in your note, possibly
because I knew that I may appear to deserve it. But

retain the idea that there was any coldness between us,
and that it would give me heartfelt satisfaction to know
the reverse.</p>

<p>I shall make a personal descent upon you before

cannot rest easy without writing it also. And if this
should lead to a better knowledge in each of us, of the

<p>There never were such considerate people as they
are here. After offering me unbounded hospitality and
my declining it, they leave me to myself like gentlemen.
They saved me from all sorts of intrusion at the Town
Hall&mdash;brought me back&mdash;and left me to my quiet supper
(now on the table) as they had left me to my quiet
dinner.</p>

<p>I wish you had come. It was really a splendid sight.
The Town Hall was crammed to the roof by, I suppose,
two thousand persons. The ladies were in full dress
and immense numbers; and when Dick showed himself,
the whole assembly stood up, rustling like the leaves of
a wood. Dick, with the heart of a lion, dashed in bravely.
He introduced that about the genie in the casket with
marvellous effect; and was applauded to the echo, which
did applaud again. He was horribly nervous when he
arrived at Birmingham,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but when he stood upon the
platform, I don't believe his pulse increased ten degrees.
A better and quicker audience never listened to man.</p>

<p>The ladies had hung the hall (do you know what an
immense place it is?) with artificial flowers all round.
And on the front of the great gallery, immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fronting this young gentleman, were the words in artificial
flowers (you'll observe) "Welcome Boz" in letters about
six feet high. Behind his head, and about the great
organ, were immense transparencies representing several
Fames crowning a corresponding number of Dicks, at

<p>I have made up my mind to "see the world," and
mean to decamp, bag and baggage, next midsummer for
a twelvemonth. I purpose establishing my family in some
convenient place, from whence I can make personal
ravages on the neighbouring country, and, somehow or
other, have got it into my head that Nice would be a
favourable spot for head-quarters. You are so well
acquainted with these matters, that I am anxious to have
the benefit of your kind advice. I do not doubt that
you can tell me whether this same Nice be a healthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
place the year through, whether it be reasonably cheap,
pleasant to look at and to live in, and the like. If you
will tell me, when you have ten minutes to spare for
such a client, I shall be delighted to come to you, and
guide myself by your opinion. I will not ask you to
forgive me for troubling you, because I am sure beforehand
that you will do so. I beg to be kindly remembered
to Count D'Orsay and to your nieces&mdash;I was going to
say "the Misses Power," but it looks so like the blue

<p>Think of Italy! Don't give that up! Why, my

<p>Yes. We must have a few books, and everything that

<p>My study fireplace having been suddenly seized
with symptoms of insanity, I have been in great affliction.
The bricklayer was called in, and considered it necessary
to perform an extensive operation without delay. I don't
know whether you are aware of a peculiar bricky raggedness
(not unaccompanied by pendent stalactites of mortar)
which is exposed to view on the removal of a stove, or
are acquainted with the suffocating properties of a kind
of accidental snuff which flies out of the same cavernous
region in great abundance. It is very distressing. I
have been walking about the house after the manner of
the dove before the waters subsided for some days, and
have no pens or ink or paper. Hence this gap in our
correspondence which I now repair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>What are you doing??? When are you coming
away???? Why are you stopping there????? Do
enlighten me, for I think of you constantly, and have

<p>D'Orsay, who knows Italy very well indeed, strenuously
insists there is no such place for headquarters as Pisa.
Lady Blessington says so also. What do you say? On

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Lady Blessington</span>,</div>

<p>Appearances are against me. Don't believe them.
I have written you, in intention, fifty letters, and I can
claim no credit for anyone of them (though they were
the best letters you ever read), for they all originated in
my desire to live in your memory and regard. Since I
heard from Count D'Orsay, I have been beset in I don't
know how many ways. First of all, I went to Marseilles
and came back to Genoa. Then I moved to the Peschiere.
Then some people, who had been present at the Scientific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Congress here, made a sudden inroad on that establishment,
and overran it. Then they went away, and I
shut myself up for a month, close and tight, over my
little Christmas book, "The Chimes." All my affections
and passions got twined and knotted up in it,
and I became as haggard as a murderer, long before I
wrote "The End." When I had done that, like "<i>The</i>
man of Thessaly," who having scratched his eyes out in
a quickset hedge, plunged into a bramble-bush to scratch
them in again, I fled to Venice, to recover the composure
I had disturbed. From thence I went to Verona and to
Mantua. And now I am here&mdash;just come up from underground,
and earthy all over, from seeing that extraordinary
tomb in which the dead saint lies in an alabaster
case, with sparkling jewels all about him to mock his
dusty eyes, not to mention the twenty-franc pieces which
devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of sky-light
in the cathedral pavement above, as if it were the
counter of his heavenly shop. You know Verona? You
know everything in Italy, <i>I</i> know. The Roman Amphitheatre
there delighted me beyond expression. I never
saw anything so full of solemn ancient interest. There
are the four-and-forty rows of seats, as fresh and
perfect as if their occupants had vacated them but
yesterday&mdash;the entrances, passages, dens, rooms, corridors,
the numbers over some of the arches. An equestrian
troop had been there some days before, and had
scooped out a little ring at one end of the arena, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
had their performances in that spot. I should like to
have seen it, of all things, for its very dreariness. Fancy
a handful of people sprinkled over one corner of the
great place (the whole population of Verona wouldn't
fill it now); and a spangled cavalier bowing to the
echoes, and the grass-grown walls! I climbed to the
topmost seat, and looked away at the beautiful view for
some minutes; when I turned round, and looked down
into the theatre again, it had exactly the appearance of
an immense straw hat, to which the helmet in the Castle
of Otranto was a baby; the rows of seats representing
the different plaits of straw, and the arena the inside of
the crown. I had great expectations of Venice, but
they fell immeasurably short of the wonderful reality.
The short time I passed there went by me in a dream.
I hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties, its
sources of interest, its uncommon novelty and freshness.
A thousand and one realisations of the Thousand
and one Nights, could scarcely captivate and enchant me
more than Venice.</p>

<p>Your old house at Albaro&mdash;Il Paradiso&mdash;is spoken
of as yours to this day. What a gallant place it is! I
don't know the present inmate, but I hear that he
bought and furnished it not long since, with great splendour,
in the French style, and that he wishes to sell it.
I wish I were rich and could buy it. There is a third-rate
wine shop below Byron's house, and the place looks
dull and miserable, and ruinous enough. Old &mdash;&mdash; is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
trifle uglier than when I first arrived. He has periodical
parties, at which there are a great many flowerpots and
a few ices&mdash;no other refreshments. He goes about, constantly
charged with extemporaneous poetry, and is
always ready, like tavern dinners, on the shortest notice
and the most reasonable terms. He keeps a gigantic
harp in his bedroom, together with pen, ink, and
paper, for fixing his ideas as they flow, a kind of
profane King David, but truly good-natured and very
harmless.</p>

<p>Pray say to Count D'Orsay everything that is cordial
and loving from me. The travelling purse he gave me
has been of immense service. It has been constantly
opened. All Italy seems to yearn to put its hand in it.
I think of hanging it, when I come back to England,
on a nail as a trophy, and of gashing the brim like the
blade of an old sword, and saying to my son and heir,
as they do upon the stage: "You see this notch, boy?
Five hundred francs were laid low on that day, for post-horses.
Where this gap is, a waiter charged your father
treble the correct amount&mdash;and got it. This end, worn
into teeth like the rasped edge of an old file, is sacred
to the Custom Houses, boy, the passports, and the
shabby soldiers at town-gates, who put an open hand
and a dirty coat-cuff into the coach windows of all 'Forestieri.'
Take it, boy. Thy father has nothing else to
give!"</p>

<p>My desk is cooling itself in a mail-coach, somewhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
down at the back of the cathedral, and the pens and ink
in this house are so detestable, that I have no hope of
your ever getting to this portion of my letter. But I
have the less misery in this state of mind, from knowing
that it has nothing in it to repay you for the trouble of
perusal.</p>

<p>Once more in my old quarters, and with rather a
tired sole to my foot, from having found such an immense
number of different resting-places for it since I went
away. I write you my last Italian letter for this bout,
designing to leave here, please God, on the ninth of
next month, and to be in London again by the end of
June. I am looking forward with great delight to the
pleasure of seeing you once more, and mean to come to
Gore House with such a swoop as shall astonish the
poodle, if, after being accustomed to his own size and
sense, he retain the power of being astonished at anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in the wide world. You know where I have been, and
every mile of ground I have travelled over, and every
object I have seen. It is next to impossible, surely, to
exaggerate the interest of Rome; though, I think, it
<i>is</i> very possible to find the main source of interest in
the wrong things. Naples disappointed me greatly. The
weather was bad during a great part of my stay there.
But if I had not had mud, I should have had dust, and
though I had had sun, I must still have had the Lazzaroni.
And they are so ragged, so dirty, so abject, so full of
degradation, so sunken and steeped in the hopelessness
of better things, that they would make heaven uncomfortable,
if they could ever get there. I didn't expect
to see a handsome city, but I expected something better
than that long dull line of squalid houses, which stretches
from the Chiaja to the quarter of the Porta Capuana;
and while I was quite prepared for a miserable populace,
I had some dim belief that there were bright rays among
them, and dancing legs, and shining sun-browned faces.
Whereas the honest truth is, that connected with Naples
itself, I have not one solitary recollection. The country
round it charmed me, I need not say. Who can forget
Herculaneum and Pompeii?</p>

<p>As to Vesuvius, it burns away in my thoughts, beside
the roaring waters of Niagara, and not a splash of the
water extinguishes a spark of the fire; but there they
go on, tumbling and flaming night and day, each in its
fullest glory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen so many wonders, and each of them has
such a voice of its own, that I sit all day long listening
to the roar they make as if it were in a sea-shell, and
have fallen into an idleness so complete, that I can't
rouse myself sufficiently to go to Pisa on the twenty-fifth,
when the triennial illumination of the Cathedral and
Leaning Tower, and Bridges, and what not, takes place.
But I have already been there; and it cannot beat St.
Peter's, I suppose. So I don't think I shall pluck
myself up by the roots, and go aboard a steamer for
Leghorn. Let me thank you heartily for the "Keepsake"
and the "Book of Beauty." They reached me a week
or two ago. I have been very much struck by two
papers in them&mdash;one, Landor's "Conversations," among
the most charming, profound, and delicate productions I
have ever read; the other, your lines on Byron's room
at Venice. I am as sure that you wrote them from your
heart, as I am that they found their way immediately to
mine.</p>

<p>It delights me to receive such accounts of Maclise's
fresco. If he will only give his magnificent genius fair
play, there is not enough cant and dulness even in the
criticism of art from which Sterne prayed kind heaven
to defend him, as the worst of all the cants continually
canted in this canting world&mdash;to keep the giant down
an hour.</p>

<p>Our poor friend, the naval governor,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has lost his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wife, I am sorry to hear, since you and I spoke of his
pleasant face. Do not let your nieces forget me, if
you can help it, and give my love to Count D'Orsay,
with many thanks to him for his charming letter. I
was greatly amused by his account of &mdash;&mdash;. There
was a cold shade of aristocracy about it, and a
dampness of cold water, which entertained me beyond
measure.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>As my note is to bear reference to business, I will
make it as short and plain as I can. I think I could
write a pretty good and a well-timed article on the <i>Punishment
of Death</i>, and sympathy with great criminals, instancing
the gross and depraved curiosity that exists in
reference to them, by some of the outrageous things that
were written, done, and said in recent cases. But as I
am not sure that my views would be yours, and as their
statement would be quite inseparable from such a paper,
I will briefly set down their purport that you may decide
for yourself.</p>

<p>Society, having arrived at that state in which it spares<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bodily torture to the worst criminals, and having agreed,
if criminals be put to death at all, to kill them in the
speediest way, I consider the question with reference to
society, and not at all with reference to the criminal,
holding that, in a case of cruel and deliberate murder,
he is already mercifully and sparingly treated. But, as
a question for the deliberate consideration of all reflective
persons, I put this view of the case. With such
very repulsive and odious details before us, may it not
be well to inquire whether the punishment of death be
beneficial to society? I believe it to have a horrible fascination
for many of those persons who render themselves
liable to it, impelling them onward to the acquisition
of a frightful notoriety; and (setting aside the strong
confirmation of this idea afforded in individual instances)
I presume this to be the case in very badly regulated
minds, when I observe the strange fascination which
everything connected with this punishment, or the object
of it, possesses for tens of thousands of decent, virtuous,
well-conducted people, who are quite unable to resist
the published portraits, letters, anecdotes, smilings, snuff-takings,
of the bloodiest and most unnatural scoundrel
with the gallows before him. I observe that this strange
interest does not prevail to anything like the same degree
where death is not the penalty. Therefore I connect it
with the dread and mystery surrounding death in any
shape, but especially in this avenging form, and am disposed
to come to the conclusion that it produces crime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in the criminally disposed, and engenders a diseased
sympathy&mdash;morbid and bad, but natural and often irresistible&mdash;among
the well-conducted and gentle. Regarding
it as doing harm to both these classes, it may even then
be right to inquire, whether it has any salutary influence
on those small knots and specks of people, mere bubbles
in the living ocean, who actually behold its infliction with
their proper eyes. On this head it is scarcely possible
to entertain a doubt, for we know that robbery, and
obscenity, and callous indifference are of no commoner
occurrence anywhere than at the foot of the scaffold.
Furthermore, we know that all exhibitions of agony and
death have a tendency to brutalise and harden the feelings
of men, and have always been the most rife among the
fiercest people. Again, it is a great question whether
ignorant and dissolute persons (ever the great body of
spectators, as few others will attend), seeing <i>that</i> murder
done, and not having seen the other, will not, almost of
necessity, sympathise with the man who dies before them,
especially as he is shown, a martyr to their fancy, tied
and bound, alone among scores, with every kind of odds
against him.</p>

<p>I should take all these threads up at the end by a
vivid little sketch of the origin and progress of such a
crime as Hooker's, stating a somewhat parallel case, but
an imaginary one, pursuing its hero to his death, and
showing what enormous harm he does <i>after</i> the crime
for which he suffers. I should state none of these positions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in a positive sledge-hammer way, but tempt and
lure the reader into the discussion of them in his own
mind; and so we come to this at last&mdash;whether it be for
the benefit of society to elevate even this crime to the
awful dignity and notoriety of death; and whether it
would not be much more to its advantage to substitute
a mean and shameful punishment, degrading the deed
and the committer of the deed, and leaving the general
compassion to expend itself upon the only theme at
present quite forgotten in the history, that is to say,
the murdered person.</p>

<p>I do not give you this as an outline of the paper,
which I think I could make attractive. It is merely
an exposition of the inferences to which its whole
philosophy must tend.</p>

<p>I write to you in great haste. I most bitterly
regret the being obliged to disappoint and inconvenience
you (as I fear I shall do), but I find it will be <i>impossible</i>
for me to write the paper on Capital Punishment for
your next number. The fault is really not mine. I have
been involved for the last fortnight in one maze of distractions,
which nothing could have enabled me to anticipate
or prevent. Everything I have had to do has been
interfered with and cast aside. I have never in my life
had so many insuperable obstacles crowded into the way
of my pursuits. It is as little my fault, believe me, as
though I were ill and wrote to you from my bed. And
pray bear as gently as you can with the vexation I occasion
you, when I tell you how very heavily it falls upon
myself.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Thompson</span>,</div>

<p>We got to Paris, in due course, on the Friday
evening. We had a pleasant and prosperous journey,
having rather cold weather in Switzerland and on the
borders thereof, and a slight detention of three hours
and a half at the frontier Custom House, atop of a mountain,
in a hard frost and a dense fog. We came into
this house last Thursday. It has a pretty drawing-room,
approached through four most extraordinary chambers.
It is the most ridiculous and preposterous house in the
world, I should think. It belongs to a Marquis Castellane,
but was fitted (so Paul Pry Poole said, who dined here
yesterday) by &mdash;&mdash; in a fit of temporary insanity, I have
no doubt. The dining-room is mere midsummer madness,
and is designed to represent a bosky grove.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>At this present writing, snow is falling in the street,
and the weather is very cold, but not so cold as it was
yesterday. I dined with Lord Normanby on Sunday last.
Everything seems to be queer and uncomfortable in the
diplomatic way, and he is rather bothered and worried,
to my thinking. I found young Sheridan (Mrs. Norton's
brother) the attach&eacute;. I know him very well, and he is
a good man for my sight-seeing purposes. There are
to be no theatricals unless the times should so adjust
themselves as to admit of their being French, to which
the Markis seems to incline, as a bit of conciliation and
a popular move.</p>

<p>Lumley, of Italian opera notoriety, also dined here
yesterday, and seems hugely afeard of the opposition
opera at Covent Garden, who have already spirited away
Grisi and Mario, which he affects to consider a great
comfort and relief. I gave him some uncompromising
information on the subject of his pit, and told him that
if he didn't conciliate the middle classes, he might depend
on being damaged, very decidedly. The danger of
the Covent Garden enterprise seems to me to be that
they are going in for ballet too, and I really don't
think the house is large enough to repay the double
expense.</p>

<p>Forster writes me that Mac has come out with
tremendous vigour in the Christmas Book, and took
off his coat at it with a burst of such alarming energy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>that he has done four subjects! Stanfield has done
three. Keeleys are making that "change"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I was so
hot upon at Lausanne, and seem ready to spend money
with bold hearts, but the cast (as far as I know it, at
present) would appear to be black despair and moody
madness. J. W. Leigh Murray, from the Princess's, is
to be the Alfred, and Forster says there is a Mrs. Gordon
at Bolton's who must be got for Grace. I am horribly
afraid &mdash;&mdash; will do one of the lawyers, and there seems to be
nobody but &mdash;&mdash; for Marion. I shall run over and carry
consternation into the establishment, as soon as I have
done the number. But I have not begun it yet, though
I hope to do so to-night, having been quite put out by
chopping and changing about, and by a vile touch of
biliousness, that makes my eyes feel as if they were
yellow bullets. "Dombey" has passed its thirty thousand
already. Do you remember a mysterious man in a straw
hat low-crowned, and a Petersham coat, who was a sort
of manager or amateur man-servant at Miss Kelly's?
Mr. Baynton Bolt, sir, came out, the other night, as
Macbeth, at the Royal Surrey Theatre.</p>

<p>There's all my news for you! Let me know, in
return, whether you have fought a duel yet with your
milingtary landlord, and whether Lausanne is still that
giddy whirl of dissipation it was wont to be, also full
particulars of your fairer and better half, and of the
baby. I will send a Christmas book to Clermont as
soon as I get any copies. And so no more at present from

<p>The Committee of the General Theatrical Fund (who

preside at their next annual dinner at the London Tavern,
and having no personal knowledge of you, have requested
me, as one of their Trustees, through their Secretary,
Mr. Cullenford, to give them some kind of presentation

<p>I will only say that I have felt great interest in their

from the first, and it has been maintained by themselves
with extraordinary perseverance and determination. It has
been in existence some years, but it is only two years since
they began to dine. At their first festival I presided, at
their second, Macready. They very naturally hold that
if they could prevail on you to reign over them now they
would secure a most powerful and excellent advocate,
whose aid would serve and grace their cause immensely.
I sympathise with their feeling so cordially, and know so
well that it would certainly be mine if I were in their case
(as, indeed, it is, being their friend), that I comply with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

<p>I feel very wicked in beginning this note, and
deeply remorseful for not having begun and ended it
long ago. But <i>you</i> know how difficult it is to write
letters in the midst of a writing life; and as you
know too (I hope) how earnestly and affectionately
I always think of you, wherever I am, I take heart,
on a little consideration, and feel comparatively good
again.</p>

<p>Forster has been cramming into the space of a fortnight
every description of impossible and inconsistent
occupation in the way of sight-seeing. He has been
now at Versailles, now in the prisons, now at the opera,
now at the hospitals, now at the Conservatoire, and now
at the Morgue, with a dreadful insatiability. I begin
to doubt whether I had anything to do with a book called
"Dombey," or ever sat over number five (not finished
a fortnight yet) day after day, until I half began, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the monk in poor Wilkie's story, to think it the only
reality in life, and to mistake all the realities for short-lived
shadows.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of sights, we saw our pleasant
little bud of a friend, Rose Ch&eacute;ri, play Clarissa Harlowe
the other night. I believe she does it in London just
now, and perhaps you may have seen it. A most charming,
intelligent, modest, affecting piece of acting it is,
with a death superior to anything I ever saw on the
stage, except Macready's Lear. The theatres are
admirable just now. We saw "Gentil Bernard" at the
Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s last night, acted in a manner that was absolutely
perfect. It was a little picture of Watteau, animated
and talking from beginning to end. At the
Cirque there is a new show-piece called the "French
Revolution," in which there is a representation of the
National Convention, and a series of battles (fought by
some five hundred people, who look like five thousand)
that are wonderful in their extraordinary vigour and
truth. Gun-cotton gives its name to the general annual
jocose review at the Palais Royal, which is dull enough,
saving for the introduction of Alexandre Dumas, sitting
in his study beside a pile of quarto volumes about five
feet high, which he says is the first tableau of the first
act of the first piece to be played on the first night of
his new theatre. The revival of Moli&egrave;re's "Don Juan,"
at the Fran&ccedil;ais, has drawn money. It is excellently
played, and it is curious to observe how different <i>their</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Don Juan and valet are from our English ideas of the
master and man. They are playing "Lucretia Borgia"
again at the Porte St. Martin, but it is poorly performed
and hangs fire drearily, though a very remarkable and
striking play. We were at Victor Hugo's house last
Sunday week, a most extraordinary place, looking like
an old curiosity shop, or the property-room of some
gloomy, vast, old theatre. I was much struck by Hugo
himself, who looks like a genius as he is, every inch of
him, and is very interesting and satisfactory from head
to foot. His wife is a handsome woman, with flashing
black eyes. There is also a charming ditto daughter
of fifteen or sixteen, with ditto eyes. Sitting among
old armour and old tapestry, and old coffers, and grim
old chairs and tables, and old canopies of state from
old palaces, and old golden lions going to play at skittles
with ponderous old golden balls, they made a most
romantic show and looked like a chapter out of one of
his own books.</p>

<p>I write to you in reference to a scheme to which
you may, perhaps, already have seen some allusion in
the London <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of to-day.</p>

<p>The party of amateurs connected with literature and
art, who acted in London two years ago, have resolved
to play again at one of the large theatres here for the
benefit of Leigh Hunt, and to make a great appeal to
all classes of society in behalf of a writer who should
have received long ago, but has not yet, some enduring
return from his country for all he has undergone and
all the good he has done. It is believed that such a
demonstration by literature on behalf of literature, and
such a mark of sympathy by authors and artists, for
one who has written so well, would be of more service,
present and prospective, to Hunt than almost any
other means of help that could be devised. And we
know, from himself, that it would be most gratifying
to his own feelings.</p>

<p>The arrangements are, as yet, in an imperfect state;
for the date of their being carried out depends on our
being able to get one of the large theatres before the
close of the present London season. In the event of
our succeeding, we purpose acting in London, on
Wednesday the 14th of July, and on Monday the 19th.
On the first occasion we shall play "Every Man in His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Humour," and a farce; on the second, "The Merry
Wives of Windsor," and a farce.</p>

<p>But we do not intend to stop here. Believing that
Leigh Hunt has done more to instruct the young men
of England, and to lend a helping hand to those who
educate themselves, than any writer in England, we are
resolved to come down, in a body, to Liverpool and
Manchester, and to act one night at each place. And
the object of my letter is, to ask you, as the representative
of the great educational establishment of Liverpool,
whether we can count on your active assistance; whether
you will form a committee to advance our object; and
whether, if we send you our circulars and addresses,
you will endeavour to secure us a full theatre, and to
enlist the general sympathy and interest in behalf of
the cause we have at heart?</p>

<p>I address, by this post, a letter, which is almost the
counterpart of the present, to the honorary secretaries of
the Manchester Athen&aelig;um. If we find in both towns
such a response as we confidently expect, I would
propose, on behalf of my friends, that the Liverpool and
Manchester Institutions should decide for us, at which
town we shall first appear, and which play we shall act
in each place.</p>

<p>I forbear entering into any more details, however,
until I am favoured with your reply.</p>

<p>The news of Mr. Hunt's pension is quite true.
We do not propose to act in London after this change in
his affairs, but we do still distinctly propose to act in
Manchester and Liverpool. I have set forth the plain
state of the case in a letter to Mr. Robinson by this
post (a counterpart of which I have addressed to Liverpool),
and to which, in the midst of a most laborious
correspondence on the subject, I beg to refer you.</p>

<p>It will be a great satisfaction to us to believe that
we shall still be successful in Manchester. There is great
and urgent need why we should be so, I assure you.</p>

<p>If you can help to bring the matter speedily into a
practical and plain shape, you will render Hunt the greatest
service.</p>

<p>I fear, in respect to your kind invitation, that neither
Jerrold nor I will feel at liberty to accept it. There was
a pathetic proposal among us that we should "keep

I fear, to stand by the brotherhood with particular constancy.
Nor do I think that we shall have more than
one very short evening in Manchester.</p>

is great promise in it, and I shall be earnest to know
how it proceeds.</p>

<p>Now, to leave these pleasant matters, and resume my
managerial character, which I shall be heartily glad
(between ourselves) to lay down again, though I have
none but pleasant correspondents, and the most easily
governable company of actors on earth.</p>

<p>I have written to Mr. Robinson by this post that I
wish these words, from our original London circular, to
stand at top of the bills, after "For the Benefit of
Mr. Leigh Hunt":</p>

<p>"It is proposed to devote a portion of the proceeds
of this benefit to the assistance of another celebrated
writer, whose literary career is at an end, and who has
no provision for the decline of his life."</p>

<p>I have also told him that there is no objection to its
being known that this is Mr. Poole, the author of "Paul
Pry," and "Little Pedlington," and many comic pieces
of great merit, and whose farce of "Turning the Tables"
we mean to finish with in Manchester. Beyond what he
will get from these benefits, he has no resource in this
wide world, <i>I know</i>. There are reasons which make it
desirable to get this fact abroad, and if you see no
objection to paragraphing it at your office (sending the
paragraph round, if you should please, to the other
Manchester papers), I should be much obliged to you.</p>

<p>You may like to know, as a means of engendering a
more complete individual interest in our actors, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
they are. Jerrold and myself you have heard of;
Mr. George Cruikshank and Mr. Leech (the best caricaturists
of any time perhaps) need no introduction.
Mr. Frank Stone (a Manchester man) and Mr. Egg are
artists of high reputation. Mr. Forster is the critic
of <i>The Examiner</i>, the author of "The Lives of the
Statesmen of the Commonwealth," and very distinguished
as a writer in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>. Mr. Lewes is
also a man of great attainments in polite literature, and
the author of a novel published not long since, called
"Ranthorpe." Mr. Costello is a periodical writer, and
a gentleman renowned as a tourist. Mr. Mark Lemon
is a dramatic author, and the editor of <i>Punch</i>&mdash;a most
excellent actor, as you will find. My brothers play small
parts, for love, and have no greater note than the Treasury
and the City confer on their disciples. Mr. Thompson
is a private gentleman. You may know all this, but I
thought it possible you might like to hold the key to
our full company. Pray use it as you will.</p>

<p>I confess to small faith in any American profits
having international copyright for their aim. But I will
carefully consider Blackwood's letter (when I get it) and
will call upon you and tell you what occurs to me in
reference to it, before I communicate with that northern
light.</p>

<p>I have been "going" to write to you for many a day
past, to thank you for your kindness to the General Theatrical
Fund people, and for your note to me; but I have waited
until I should hear of your being stationary somewhere.
What you said of the "Battle of Life" gave me great
pleasure. I was thoroughly wretched at having to use the
idea for so short a story. I did not see its full capacity
until it was too late to think of another subject, and I have
always felt that I might have done a great deal better if I
had taken it for the groundwork of a more extended book.
But for an insuperable aversion I have to trying back in
such a case, I should certainly forge that bit of metal again,
as you suggest&mdash;one of these days perhaps.</p>

<p>I have not been special constable myself to-day&mdash;thinking
there was rather an epidemic in that wise abroad.
I walked over and looked at the preparations, without any

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Mrs. Cowden Clarke</span>,</div>

<p>I did not understand, when I had the pleasure of
conversing with you the other evening, that you had really
considered the subject, and desired to play. But I am very
glad to understand it now; and I am sure there will be a
universal sense among us of the grace and appropriateness
of such a proceeding. Falstaff (who depends very much on
Mrs. Quickly) may have in his modesty, some timidity
about acting with an amateur actress. But I have no
question, as you have studied the part, and long wished to
play it, that you will put him completely at his ease on the
first night of your rehearsal. Will you, towards that end,
receive this as a solemn "call" to rehearsal of "The Merry
Wives" at Miss Kelly's theatre, to-morrow (Saturday) <i>week</i>
at seven in the evening?</p>

<p>And will you let me suggest another point for your
consideration? On the night when "The Merry Wives"
will <i>not</i> be played, and when "Every Man in his Humour"
<i>will</i> be, Kenny's farce of "Love, Law, and Physic" will be
acted. In that farce there is a very good character (one
Mrs. Hilary, which I have seen Mrs. Orger, I think, act to
admiration), that would have been played by Mrs. C. Jones,
if she had acted Dame Quickly, as we at first intended. If
you find yourself quite comfortable and at ease among us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in Mrs. Quickly, would you like to take this other part too?
It is an excellent farce, and is safe, I hope, to be very well
done.</p>

<p>We do not play to purchase the house<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (which may be
positively considered as paid for), but towards endowing a
perpetual curatorship of it, for some eminent literary
veteran. And I think you will recognise in this even a
higher and more gracious object than the securing, even,
of the debt incurred for the house itself.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>You very likely know that my company of amateurs
have lately been playing, with a great reputation, in
London here. The object is, "The endowment of a perpetual
curatorship of Shakespeare's house, to be always
held by some one distinguished in literature, and more
especially in dramatic literature," and we have already
a pledge from the Shakespeare House Committee that
Sheridan Knowles shall be recommended to the Government
as the first curator. This pledge, which is in the
form of a minute, we intend to advertise in our country
bills.</p>

<p>Now, on Monday, the 5th of June, we are going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
play at Liverpool, where we are assured of a warm
reception, and where an active committee for the issuing
of tickets is already formed. Do you think the Manchester
people would be equally glad to see us again,
and that the house could be filled, as before, at our old
prices? <i>If yes, would you and our other friends go, at
once, to work in the cause?</i> The only night on which
we could play in Manchester would be Saturday, the
3rd of June. It is possible that the depression of the
times may render a performance in Manchester unwise.
In that case I would immediately abandon the idea.
But what I want to know, <i>by return of post</i> is, is it
safe or unsafe? If the former, here is the bill as it
stood in London, with the addition, on the back, of a
paragraph I would insert in Manchester, of which immediate
use can be made. If the latter, my reason for
wishing to settle the point immediately is that we may
make another use of that Saturday night.</p>

<p>Assured of your generous feeling I make no apology
for troubling you. A sum of money, got together by
these means, will insure to literature (I will take good
care of that) a proper expression of itself in the bestowal
of an essentially literary appointment, not only now but
henceforth. Much is to be done, time presses, and the
least added the better.</p>

<p>I have addressed a counterpart of this letter to Mr.
Francis Robinson, to whom perhaps you will communicate
the bill.</p>

Faithfully yours always.

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Sir</span>,</div>

<p>I hasten to let you know what took place at Eton
to-day. I found that I <i>did</i> stand in some sort committed
to Mr. Evans, though not so much so but that I could with
perfect ease have declined to place Charley in his house if I
had desired to do so. I must say, however, that after seeing
Mr. Cookesley (a most excellent man in his way) and seeing
Mr. Evans, and Mr. Evans's house, I think I should, under
any circumstances, have given the latter the preference
as to the domestic part of Charley's life. I would certainly
prefer to try it. I therefore thought it best to propose
to have Mr. Cookesley for his tutor, and to place him as
a boarder with Mr. Evans. Both gentlemen seemed satisfied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
with this arrangement, and Dr. Hawtrey expressed his
approval of it also.</p>

<p>Mr. Cookesley, wishing to know what Charley could
do, asked me if I would object to leaving him there for
half-an-hour or so. As Charley appeared not at all afraid
of this proposal, I left him then and there. On my
return, Mr. Cookesley said, in high and unqualified terms,
that he had been thoroughly well grounded and well
taught&mdash;that he had examined him in Virgil and Herodotus,
and that he not only knew what he was about perfectly
well, but showed an intelligence in reference to those
authors which did his tutor great credit. He really
appeared most interested and pleased, and filled me with
a grateful feeling towards you, to whom Charley owes
so much.</p>

<p>He said there were certain verses in imitation of Horace
(I really forget what sort of verses) to which Charley was
unaccustomed, and which were a little matter enough in
themselves, but were made a great point of at Eton, and
could be got up well in a month "<i>from an Old Etonian</i>."
For this purpose he would desire Charley to be sent every
day to a certain Mr. Hardisty, in Store Street, Bedford
Square, to whom he had already (in my absence) prepared
a note. Between ourselves, I must not hesitate to tell
you plainly that this appeared to me to be a conventional
way of bestowing a little patronage. But, of course, I
had nothing for it but to say it should be done; upon
which, Mr. Cookesley added that he was then certain that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Charley, on coming after the Christmas holidays, would
be placed at once in "the remove," which seemed to
surprise Mr. Evans when I afterwards told him of it
as a high station.</p>

<p>I will take him to this gentleman on Monday, and
arrange for his going there every day; but, if you will
not object, I should still like him to remain with you, and
to have the advantage of preparing these annoying verses
under your eye until the holidays. That Mr. Cookesley
may have his own way thoroughly, I will send Charley to
Mr. Hardisty daily until the school at Eton recommences.</p>

<p>Let me impress upon you in the strongest manner,
not only that I was inexpressibly delighted myself by
the readiness with which Charley went through this
ordeal with a stranger, but that I also saw you would
have been well pleased and much gratified if you could
have seen Mr. Cookesley afterwards. He had evidently
not expected such a result, and took it as not at all an
ordinary one.</p>

<p>You will not be offended by my saying that (in

inasmuch as our London correspondent, seldom knowing
anything, feels bound to know everything, and becomes in
consequence a very reckless gentleman in respect of the
truthfulness of his intelligence.</p>

<p>In your paper, sent to me this morning, I see the
correspondent mentions one &mdash;&mdash;, and records how I was
wont to feast in the house of the said &mdash;&mdash;. As I never
was in the man's house in my life, or within five miles of
it that I know of, I beg you will do me the favour to
contradict this.</p>

<p>You will be the less surprised by my begging you to
set this right, when I tell you that, hearing of his book,
and knowing his history, I wrote to New York denouncing
him as "a forger and a thief;" that he thereupon put the
gentleman who published my letter into prison, and that
having but one day before the sailing of the last steamer to
collect the proofs printed in the accompanying sheet (which
are but a small part of the villain's life), I got them
together in short time, and sent them out to justify the
character I gave him. It is not agreeable to me to be

<p>I have had the long-contemplated talk with Forster
about the play, and write to assure you that I shall be
delighted to come down to Knebworth and do Bobadil, or
anything else, provided it would suit your convenience to
hold the great dramatic festival in the last week of October.
The concluding number of "Copperfield" will prevent me
from leaving here until Saturday, the 26th of that month.
If I were at my own disposal, I hope I need not say I
should be at yours.</p>

<p>Forster will tell you with what men we must do the
play, and what laurels we would propose to leave for the
gathering of new aspirants; of whom I hope you have a
reasonable stock in your part of the country.</p>

<p>Do you know Mary Boyle&mdash;daughter of the old Admiral?
because she is the very best actress I ever saw off the stage,
and immeasurably better than a great many I have seen
on it. I have acted with her in a country house in
Northamptonshire, and am going to do so again next
November. If you know her, I think she would be more
than pleased to play, and by giving her something good in
a farce we could get her to do Mrs. Kitely. In that case
my little sister-in-law would "go on" for the second lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and you could do without actresses, besides giving the
thing a particular grace and interest.</p>

<p>If we could get Mary Boyle, we would do "Used Up,"
which is a delightful piece, as the farce. But maybe you
know nothing about the said Mary, and in that case I
should like to know what you would think of doing.</p>

<p>You gratify me more than I can tell you by what you
say about "Copperfield," the more so as I hope myself
that some heretofore-deficient qualities are there. You are
not likely to misunderstand me when I say that I like it
very much, and am deeply interested in it, and that I have
kept and am keeping my mind very steadily upon it.</p>

<p>I should have waited at home to-day on the chance
of your calling, but that I went over to look after Lemon;
and I went for this reason: the surgeon opines that
there is no possibility of Mrs. Dickens being able to play,
although she is going on "as well as possible," which I
sincerely believe.</p>

<p>Now, <i>when</i> the accident happened, Mrs. Lemon told my
little sister-in-law that she would gladly undertake the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
part if it should become necessary. Going after her to-day,
I found that she and Lemon had gone out of town, but
will be back to-night. I have written to her, earnestly
urging her to the redemption of her offer. I have no
doubt of being able to see her well up in the characters;
and I hope you approve of this remedy. If she once
screws her courage to the sticking place, I have no fear
of her whatever. This is what I would say to you. If
I don't see you here, I will write to you at Forster's,
reporting progress. Don't be discouraged, for I am full
of confidence, and resolve to do the utmost that is in
me&mdash;and I well know they all will&mdash;to make the nights
at Knebworth <i>triumphant</i>. Once in a thing like this&mdash;once
in everything, to my thinking&mdash;it must be carried
out like a mighty enterprise, heart and soul.</p>

<p>Pray regard me as wholly at the disposal of the
theatricals, until they shall be gloriously achieved.</p>

<p>My unfortunate other half (lying in bed) is very
anxious that I should let you know that she means to
break her heart if she should be prevented from coming
as one of the audience, and that she has been devising
means all day of being brought down in the brougham

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer</span>,</div>

<p>I am so sorry to have missed you! I had gone
down to Forster, comedy in hand.</p>

<p>I think it <i>most admirable</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Full of character, strong in
interest, rich in capital situations, and <i>certain to go nobly</i>.
You know how highly I thought of "Money," but I
sincerely think these three acts finer. I did not think of
the slight suggestions you make, but I said, <i>en passant</i>,
that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the
stage a little concentrated. I don't believe it would require
even that, with the leading-up which you propose. I
cannot say too much of the comedy to express what I think
and feel concerning it; and I look at it, too, remember,
with the yellow eye of an actor! I should have taken to it
(need I say so!) <i>con amore</i> in any case, but I should have
been jealous of your reputation, exactly as I appreciate
your generosity. If I had a misgiving of ten lines I
should have scrupulously mentioned it.</p>

<p>Stone will take the Duke capitally; and I will answer
for his being got into doing it <i>very well</i>. Looking down
the perspective of a few winter evenings here, I am
confident about him. Forster will be thoroughly sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and real. Lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy
on the stage, that I don't think any actor could touch his
part as he will; and I hope you will have opportunities of
testing the accuracy of this prediction. Egg ought to do
the Author to absolute perfection. As to Jerrold&mdash;there
he stands in the play! I would propose Leech (well made
up) for Easy. He is a good name, and I see nothing else
for him.</p>

<p>This brings me to my own part. If we had anyone, or
could get anyone, for Wilmot, I could do (I think) something
so near your meaning in Sir Gilbert, that I let him
go with a pang. Assumption has charms for me&mdash;I hardly
know for how many wild reasons&mdash;so delightful, that I feel
a loss of, oh! I can't say what exquisite foolery, when I
lose a chance of being someone in voice, etc., not at all
like myself. But&mdash;I speak quite freely, knowing you will
not mistake me&mdash;I know from experience that we could
find nobody to hold the play together in Wilmot if I
didn't do it. I think I could touch the gallant, generous,
careless pretence, with the real man at the bottom of it, so
as to take the audience with him from the first scene. I
am quite sure I understand your meaning; and I am
absolutely certain that as Jerrold, Forster, and Stone came
in, I could, as a mere little bit of mechanics, present
them better by doing that part, and paying as much
attention to their points as my own, than another amateur
actor could. Therefore I throw up my cap for Wilmot, and
hereby devote myself to him, heart and head!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>I ought to tell you that in a play we once rehearsed and
never played (but rehearsed several times, and very carefully),
I saw Lemon do a piece of reality with a rugged
pathos in it, which I felt, as I stood on the stage with him
to be extraordinarily good. In the serious part of Sir
Gilbert he will surprise you. And he has an intuitive discrimination
in such things which will just keep the suspicious
part from being too droll at the outset&mdash;which will just
show a glimpse of something in the depths of it.</p>

<p>The moment I come back to town (within a fortnight,
please God!) I will ascertain from Forster where you are.
Then I will propose to you that we call our company
together, agree upon one general plan of action, and that
you and I immediately begin to see and book our Vice-Presidents,
etc. Further, I think we ought to see about the
Queen. I would suggest our playing first about three
weeks before the opening of the Exhibition, in order that
it may be the town talk before the country people and
foreigners come. Macready thinks with me that a very
large sum of money may be got in London.</p>

<p>I propose (for cheapness and many other considerations)
to make a theatre expressly for the purpose, which we can
put up and take down&mdash;say in the Hanover Square Rooms&mdash;and
move into the country. As Watson wanted something
of a theatre made for his forthcoming Little Go, I have
made it a sort of model of what I mean, and shall be able
to test its working powers before I see you. Many things
that, for portability, were to be avoided in Mr. Hewitt's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
theatre, I have replaced with less expensive and weighty
contrivances.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Bulwer, I have come to the small hours,
and am writing alone here, as if <i>I</i> were writing something
to do what your comedy will. At such a time the temptation
is strong upon me to say a great deal more, but I will
only say this&mdash;in mercy to you&mdash;that I do devoutly believe
that this plan carried, will entirely change the status of the
literary man in England, and make a revolution in his
position, which no Government, no power on earth but his
own, could ever effect. I have implicit confidence in the
scheme&mdash;so splendidly begun&mdash;if we carry it out with a
steadfast energy. I have a strong conviction that we
hold in our hands the peace and honour of men of letters
for centuries to come, and that you are destined to be their
best and most enduring benefactor.</p>

<p>Oh! what a procession of New Years might walk out of
all this, after we are very dusty!</p>

<div class='sig'>
Ever yours faithfully.<br />

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have forgotten something. I suggest this title:

<p>I know you will be glad to hear what I have to
tell you.</p>

<p>I wrote to the Duke of Devonshire this morning,
enclosing him the rough proof of the scheme, and
plainly telling him what we wanted, <i>i.e.</i>, to play for the
first time at his house, to the Queen and Court. Within
a couple of hours he wrote me as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I have read with very great interest the prospectus
of the new endowment which you have confided
to my perusal.</p>

<p>"Your manner of doing so is a proof that I am
honoured by your goodwill and approbation.</p>

<p>"I'm truly happy to offer you my earnest and sincere
co-operation. My services, my house, and my subscription
will be at your orders. And I beg you to let me
see you before long, not merely to converse upon this
subject, but because I have long had the greatest wish
to improve our acquaintance, which has, as yet, been
only one of crowded rooms."</p></div>

<p>This is quite princely, I think, and will push us along
as brilliantly as heart could desire. Don't you think
so too?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday Lemon and I saw the Secretary of the
National Provident Institution (the best Office for the
purpose, I am inclined to think) and stated all our
requirements. We appointed to meet the chairman and
directors next Tuesday; so on the day of our reading
and dining I hope we shall have that matter in good
time.</p>

<p>The theatre is also under consultation; and directly
after the reading we shall go briskly to work in all
departments.</p>

<p>I hear nothing but praises of your Macready speech&mdash;of
its eloquence, delicacy, and perfect taste, all of
which it is good to hear, though I know it all beforehand
as well as most men can tell it me.</p>

<p>Coming home at midnight last night after our first
rehearsal, I find your letter. I write to entreat you, if
you make any change in the first three acts, to let it be
only of the slightest kind. Because we are now fairly
under way, everybody is already drilled into his place,
and in two or three rehearsals those acts will be in a
tolerably presentable state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>It is of vital importance that we should get the last
two acts <i>soon</i>. The Queen and Prince are coming&mdash;Phipps
wrote me yesterday the most earnest letter possible&mdash;the
time is fearfully short, and we <i>must</i> have the comedy
in such a state as that it will go like a machine. Whatever
you do, for heaven's sake don't be persuaded to
endanger that!</p>

<p>Even at the risk of your falling into the pit with
despair at beholding anything of the comedy in its
present state, if you can by any possibility come down
to Covent Garden Theatre to-night, do. I hope you will
see in Lemon the germ of a very fine presentation of
Sir Geoffrey. I think Topham, too, will do Easy
admirably.</p>

<p>We really did wonders last night in the way of arrangement.
I see the ground-plan of the first three acts distinctly.
The dressing and furnishing and so forth, will
be a perfect picture, and I will answer for the men in
three weeks' time.</p>

<p>Ah, those were days indeed, when we were so
fatigued at dinner that we couldn't speak, and so revived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at supper that we couldn't go to bed; when wild in inns
the noble savage ran; and all the world was a stage, gas-lighted
in a double sense&mdash;by the Young Gas and the
old one! When Emmeline Montague (now Compton,
and the mother of two children) came to rehearse in our
new comedy<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the other night, I nearly fainted. The

London last Monday to preside at a public dinner&mdash;played

<span class="smcap">Devonshire Terrace</span>, <i>Monday, 28th April, 1851.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer</span>,</div>

<p>I see you are so anxious, that I shall endeavour to
send you this letter by a special messenger. I think I
can relieve your mind completely.</p>

<p>The Duke has read the play. He asked for it a week
ago, and had it. He has been at Brighton since. He
called here before eleven on Saturday morning, but I
was out on the play business, so I went to him at Devonshire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
House yesterday. He almost knows the play by
heart. He is supremely delighted with it, and critically
understands it. In proof of the latter part of this sentence
I may mention that he had made two or three memoranda
of trivial doubtful points, <i>every one of which had attracted
our attention in rehearsal</i>, as I found when he showed
them to me. He thoroughly understands and appreciates
the comedy of the Duke&mdash;threw himself back in his chair
and laughed, as I say of Walpole, "till I thought he'd have
choked," about his first Duchess, who was a Percy. He
suggested that he shouldn't say: "You know how to speak
to the heart of a Noble," because it was not likely that he
would call himself a Noble. He thought we might close up
the Porter and Softhead a little more (already done) and
was so charmed and delighted to recall the comedy that he
was more pleased than any boy you ever saw when I
repeated two or three of the speeches in my part for him.
He is coming to the rehearsal to-day (we rehearse now at
Devonshire House, three days a-week, all day long), and,
since he read the play, has conceived a most magnificent
and noble improvement in the Devonshire House plan, by
which, I daresay, we shall get another thousand or fifteen
hundred pounds. There is not a grain of distrust or doubt
in him. I am perfectly certain that he would confide to
me, and does confide to me, his whole mind on the
subject.</p>

<p>More than this, the Duke comes out the best man in
the play. I am happy to report to you that Stone does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the honourable manly side of that pride inexpressibly better
than I should have supposed possible in him. The scene
where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is
<i>certain</i> to be an effect. He is <i>not</i> a jest upon the order of
Dukes, but a great tribute to them. I have sat looking
at the play (as you may suppose) pretty often, and carefully
weighing every syllable of it. I see, in the Duke, the most
estimable character in the piece. I am as sure that I
represent the audience in this as I am that I hear the words
when they are spoken before me. The first time that scene
with Hardman was seriously done, it made an effect on
the company that quite surprised and delighted me; and
whenever and wherever <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it it'">it</ins> is done (but most of all at
Devonshire House) the result will be the same.</p>

<p>Everyone is greatly improved. I wrote an earnest
note to Forster a few days ago on the subject of his being
too loud and violent. He has since subdued himself with
the most admirable pains, and improved the part a thousand
per cent. All the points are gradually being worked and
smoothed out with the utmost neatness all through the
play. They are all most heartily anxious and earnest, and,
upon the least hitch, will do the same thing twenty times
over. The scenery, furniture, etc., are rapidly advancing
towards completion, and will be beautiful. The dresses are
a perfect blaze of colour, and there is not a pocket-flap
or a scrap of lace that has not been made according to
Egg's drawings to the quarter of an inch. Every wig has
been made from an old print or picture. From the Duke's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
snuff-box to Will's Coffee-house, you will find everything in
perfect truth and keeping. I have resolved that whenever
we come to a weak place in the acting, it must, somehow
or other, be made a strong one. The places that I used
to be most afraid of are among the best points now.</p>

<p>Will you come to the dress rehearsal on the Tuesday
evening before the Queen's night? There will be no one
present but the Duke.</p>

<p>I write in the greatest haste, for the rehearsal time is
close at hand, and I have the master carpenter and gasman
to see before we begin.</p>

<p>Miss Coutts is one of the most sensible of women, and
if I had not seen the Duke yesterday, I would have shown
her the play directly. But there can't be any room for
anxiety on the head that has troubled you so much. You
may clear it from your mind as completely as Gunpowder
Plot.</p>

<p>You never saw such a sight as the sands between
this and Margate presented yesterday. This day fortnight
a steamer laden with cattle going from Rotterdam
to the London market, was wrecked on the Goodwin&mdash;on
which occasion, by-the-bye, the coming in at night
of our Salvage Luggers laden with dead cattle, which
where hoisted up upon the pier where they lay in heaps,
was a most picturesque and striking sight. The sea since
Wednesday has been very rough, blowing in straight
upon the land. Yesterday, the shore was strewn with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
hundreds of oxen, sheep, and pigs (and with bushels upon
bushels of apples), in every state and stage of decay&mdash;burst
open, rent asunder, lying with their stiff hoofs in
the air, or with their great ribs yawning like the wrecks
of ships&mdash;tumbled and beaten out of shape, and yet with
a horrible sort of humanity about them. Hovering among
these carcases was every kind of water-side plunderer,
pulling the horns out, getting the hides off, chopping
the hoofs with poleaxes, etc. etc., attended by no end
of donkey carts, and spectral horses with scraggy necks,
galloping wildly up and down as if there were something
maddening in the stench. I never beheld such a

<p>Your letter, received this morning, has considerably
allayed the anguish of my soul. Our letters crossed,
of course, as letters under such circumstances always
do.</p>

<p>I am perpetually wandering (in fancy) up and down
the house<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and tumbling over the workmen; when I feel
that they are gone to dinner I become low, when I look
forward to their total abstinence on Sunday, I am wretched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
The gravy at dinner has a taste of glue in it. I smell paint
in the sea. Phantom lime attends me all the day long. I
dream that I am a carpenter and can't partition off the hall.
I frequently dance (with a distinguished company) in the
drawing-room, and fall into the kitchen for want of a
pillar.</p>


<p>A great to-do here. A steamer lost on the Goodwins
yesterday, and our men bringing in no end of dead
cattle and sheep. I stood a supper for them last night,
to the unbounded gratification of Broadstairs. They came
in from the wreck very wet and tired, and very much
disconcerted by the nature of their prize&mdash;which, I suppose,
after all, will have to be recommitted to the sea, when
the hides and tallow are secured. One lean-faced boatman
murmured, when they were all ruminative over the bodies
as they lay on the pier: "Couldn't sassages be made on
it?" but retired in confusion shortly afterwards, overwhelmed
by the execrations of the bystanders.</p>

<p>I left Liverpool at four o'clock this morning, and
am so blinded by excitement, gas, and waving hats and
handkerchiefs, that I can hardly see to write, but I
cannot go to bed without telling you what a triumph we
have had. Allowing for the necessarily heavy expenses
of all kinds, I believe we can hardly fund less than a
Thousand Pounds out of this trip alone. And, more than
that, the extraordinary interest taken in the idea of the
Guild by "this grand people of England" down in these
vast hives, and the enthusiastic welcome they give it,
assure me that we may do what we will if we will only
be true and faithful to our design. There is a social
recognition of it which I cannot give you the least idea
of. I sincerely believe that we have the ball at our feet,
and may throw it up to the very Heaven of Heavens.
And I don't speak for myself alone, but for all our
people, and not least of all for Forster, who has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
absolutely stunned by the tremendous earnestness of these
great places.</p>

<p>To tell you (especially after your affectionate letter)
what I would have given to have had you there would
be idle. But I can most seriously say that all the sights
of the earth turned pale in my eyes, before the sight of
three thousand people with one heart among them, and
no capacity in them, in spite of all their efforts, of sufficiently
testifying to you how they believe you to be
right, and feel that they cannot do enough to cheer you
on. They understood the play (<i>far better acted by this
time than ever you have seen it</i>) as well as you do.
They allowed nothing to escape them. They rose up,
when it was over, with a perfect fury of delight, and
the Manchester people sent a requisition after us to
Liverpool to say that if we will go back there in May,
when we act at Birmingham (as of course we shall)
they will joyfully undertake to fill the Free Trade Hall
again. Among the Tories of Liverpool the reception was
equally enthusiastic. We played, two nights running,
to a hall crowded to the roof&mdash;more like the opera at
Genoa or Milan than anything else I can compare it to.
We dined at the Town Hall magnificently, and it made
no difference in the response. I said what we were
quietly determined to do (when the Guild was given as
the toast of the night), and really they were so noble
and generous in their encouragement that I should have
been more ashamed of myself than I hope I ever shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
be, if I could have felt conscious of having ever for a
moment faltered in the work.</p>

<p>I will answer for Birmingham&mdash;for any great working
town to which we chose to go. We have won a position
for the idea which years upon years of labour could
not have given it. I believe its worldly fortunes have
been advanced in this last week fifty years at least. I
feebly express to you what Forster (who couldn't be at
Liverpool, and has not those shouts ringing in his ears)
has felt from the moment he set foot in Manchester.
Believe me we may carry a perfect fiery cross through
the North of England, and over the Border, in this
cause, if need be&mdash;not only to the enrichment of the
cause, but to the lasting enlistment of the people's
sympathy.</p>

<p>I have been so happy in all this that I could have
cried on the shortest notice any time since Tuesday.
And I do believe that our whole body would have gone
to the North Pole with me if I had shown them good
reason for it.</p>

<p>I hope I am not so tired but that you may be able
to read this. I have been at it almost incessantly, day
and night for a week, and I am afraid my handwriting
suffers. But in all other respects I am only a giant
refreshed.</p>

<p>We meet next Saturday you recollect? Until then,
and ever afterwards,</p>

<div class='sig'>
Believe me, heartily yours.

In the case of the Sheffield grinders the difficulty

<p>I am sorry, but Brutus sacrifices unborn children of
his own as well as those of other people. "The Sorrows
of Childhood," long in type, and long a mere mysterious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
name, must come out. The paper really is, like the
celebrated ambassadorial appointment, "too bad."</p>

<p>"A Doctor of Morals," <i>impossible of insertion as it
stands</i>. A mere puff, with all the difficult facts of the
question blinked, and many statements utterly at variance
with what I am known to have written. It is exactly
because the great bulk of offences in a great number of
places are committed by professed thieves, that it will not
do to have pet prisoning advocated without grave remonstrance
and great care. That class of prisoner is not to be
reformed. We must begin at the beginning and prevent,
by stringent correction and supervision of wicked parents,
that class of prisoner from being regularly supplied as if he
were a human necessity.</p>

<p>Do they teach trades in workhouses and try to fit <i>their</i>
people (the worst part of them) for society? Come with
me to Tothill Fields Bridewell, and I will show you what a
workhouse girl is. Or look to my "Walk in a Workhouse"
(in "H. W.") and to the glance at the youths I
saw in one place positively kept like wolves.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; thinks prisons could be made nearly self-supporting.
Have you any idea of the difficulty that is found in
disposing of Prison-work, or does he think that the Treadmills
didn't grind the air because the State or the Magistracy
objected to the competition of prison-labour with
free-labour, but because the work <i>could not be got?</i></p>

<p>I never can have any kind of prison-discipline disquisition
in "H. W." that does not start with the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
great principle I have laid down, and that does not
protest against Prisons being considered <i>per se</i>. Whatever
chance is given to a man in a prison must be given to a
man in a refuge for distress.</p>

<p>The article in itself is very good, but it must have
these points in it, otherwise I am not only compromising
opinions I am known to hold, but the journal itself is
blowing hot and cold, and playing fast and loose in a
ridiculous way.</p>

<p>"Starting a Paper in India" is very droll to us. But it
is full of references that the public don't understand, and
don't in the least care for. Bourgeois, brevier, minion, and
nonpareil, long primer, turn-ups, dunning advertisements,
and reprints, back forme, imposing-stone, and locking-up,
are all quite out of their way, and a sort of slang that they
have no interest in.</p>

<p>Let me see a revise when you have got it together, and
if you can strengthen it&mdash;do. I mention all the objections
that occur to me as I go on, not because you can obviate
them (except in the case of the prison-paper), but because
if I make a point of doing so always you will feel and judge
the more readily both for yourself and me too when I take
an Italian flight.</p>

<p>Can't possibly write autographs until I have written
"Bleak House." My work has been very hard since I
have been here; and when I throw down my pen of a day,
I throw down myself, and can take up neither article.</p>

<p>The "C. P." is very well done, but I cannot make up
my mind to lend my blow to the great Forge-bellows of
puffery at work. I so heartily desire to have nothing to
do with it, that I wish you would cancel this article
altogether, and substitute something else. As to the
guide-books, I think they are a sufficiently flatulent
botheration in themselves, without being discussed. A
lurking desire is always upon me to put Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s speech
on Accidents to the public, as chairman of the Brighton
Railway, against his pretensions as a chairman of public
instructors and guardians. And I don't know but that I
may come to it at some odd time. This strengthens me
in my wish to avoid the bellows.</p>

<p>How two men can have gone, one after the other, to
the Camp, and have written nothing about it, passes my
comprehension. I have been in great doubt about the end
of &mdash;&mdash;. I wish you would suggest to him from me, when
you see him, how wrong it is. Surely he cannot be insensible
to the fact that military preparations in England
at this time mean Defence. Woman, says &mdash;&mdash;, means
Home, love, children, Mother. Does he not find any protection
for these things in a wise and moderate means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Defence; and is not the union between these things and
those means one of the most natural, significant, and plain
in the world?</p>

<p>I wish you would send friend Barnard here a set of
"Household Words," in a paid parcel (on the other side
is an inscription to be neatly pasted into vol. i. before
sending), with a post-letter beforehand from yourself,
saying that I had begged you to forward the books, feeling

<i>Thursday Night, 20th October, 1853.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Kate</span>,</div>

<p>We<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> came here last night after a very long journey
over very bad roads, from Geneva, and leave here (for
Montigny, by the T&ecirc;te Noire) at 6 to-morrow morning.
Next morning early we mean to try the Simplon.</p>

<p>After breakfast to-day we ascended to the Mer de Glace&mdash;wonderfully
different at this time of the year from when
we saw it&mdash;a great portion of the ascent being covered with
snow, and the climbing very difficult. Regardless of my
mule, I walked up and walked down again, to the great
admiration of the guides, who pronounced me "an
Intrepid." The little house at the top being closed for the
winter, and Edward having forgotten to carry any brandy,
we had nothing to drink at the top&mdash;which was a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
disappointment to the Inimitable, who was
streaming with perspiration from head to foot. But we
made a fire in the snow with some sticks, and after a not
too comfortable rest came down again. It took a long
time&mdash;from 10 to 3.</p>

<p>The appearance of Chamounix at this time of year is
very remarkable. The travellers are over for the season,
the inns are generally shut up, all the people who can
afford it are moving off to Geneva, the snow is low on the
mountains, and the general desolation and grandeur extraordinarily
fine. I wanted to pass by the Col de Balme,
but the snow lies too deep upon it.</p>

<p>You would have been quite delighted if you could have
seen the warmth of our old Lausanne friends, and the
heartiness with which they crowded down on a fearfully
bad morning to see us off. We passed the night at the
Ecu de Gen&egrave;ve, in the rooms once our old rooms&mdash;at
that time (the day before yesterday) occupied by the
Queen of the French (ex- I mean) and Prince Joinville and
his family.</p>

<p>Tell Sydney that all the way here from Geneva, and up
to the Sea of Ice this morning, I wore his knitting, which
was very comfortable indeed. I mean to wear it on the
long mule journey to Martigny to-morrow.</p>

<p>We get on extremely well. Edward continues as
before. He had never been here, and I took him up
to the Mer de Glace this morning, and had a mule
for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall leave this open, as usual, to add a word or
two on our arrival at Martigny. We have had an
amusingly absurd incident this afternoon. When we
came here, I saw added to the hotel&mdash;our old hotel, and
I am now writing in the room where we once dined at
the table d'h&ocirc;te&mdash;some baths, cold and hot, down on
the margin of the torrent below. This induced us to
order three hot baths. Thereupon the keys of the
bath-rooms were found with immense difficulty, women
ran backwards and forwards across the bridge, men
bore in great quantities of wood, a horrible furnace was
lighted, and a smoke was raised which filled the whole
valley. This began at half-past three, and we congratulated
each other on the distinction we should probably
acquire by being the cause of the conflagration of the
whole village. We sat by the fire until half-past five
(dinner-time), and still no baths. Then Edward came
up to say that the water was as yet only "tippit,"
which we suppose to be tepid, but that by half-past
eight it would be in a noble state. Ever since the
smoke has poured forth in enormous volume, and the
furnace has blazed, and the women have gone and come
over the bridge, and piles of wood have been carried
in; but we observe a general avoidance of us by the
establishment which still looks like failure. We have
had a capital dinner, the dessert whereof is now on the
table. When we arrived, at nearly seven last night, all
the linen in the house, newly washed, was piled in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sitting-room, all the curtains were taken down, and all
the chairs piled bottom upwards. They cleared away
as much as they could directly, and had even got the
curtains up at breakfast this morning.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to letters at Genoa, though I
doubt if we shall get there (supposing all things right
at the Simplon) before Monday night or Tuesday morning.
I found there last night what F&mdash;&mdash; would call
"Mr. Smith's" story of Mont Blanc, and took it to bed
to read. It is extremely well and unaffectedly done.
You would be interested in it.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Catherine</span>,</div>

<p>The road from Chamounix here takes so much
more time than I supposed (for I travelled it day and
night, and my companions don't at all understand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
idea of never going to bed) that we only reached Milan
last night, though we had been travelling twelve and
fifteen hours a day. We crossed the Simplon on Sunday,
when there was not (as there is not now) a particle of
cloud in the whole sky, and when the pass was as nobly
grand and beautiful as it possibly can be. There was
a good deal of snow upon the top, but not across the
road, which had been cleared. We crossed the Austrian
frontier yesterday, and, both there and at the gate of
Milan, received all possible consideration and politeness.</p>

<p>I have not seen Bairr yet. He has removed from
the old hotel to a larger one at a few hours' distance.
The head-waiter remembered me very well last night
after I had talked to him a little while, and was greatly
interested in hearing about all the family, and about
poor Roche. The boy we used to have at Lausanne
is now seventeen-and-a-half&mdash;very tall, he says. The
elder girl, fifteen, very like her mother, but taller and
more beautiful. He described poor Mrs. Bairr's death
(I am speaking of the head-waiter before mentioned) in
most vivacious Italian. It was all over in ten minutes,
he said. She put her hands to her head one day, down
in the courtyard, and cried out that she heard little
bells ringing violently in her ears. They sent off for
Bairr, who was close by. When she saw him, she
stretched out her arms, said in English, "Adieu, my
dear!" and fell dead. He has not married again, and he
never will. She was a good woman (my friend went on),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
excellent woman, full of charity, loved the poor, but
<i>un poco furiosa</i>&mdash;that was nothing!</p>

<p>The new hotel is just like the old one, admirably
kept, excellently furnished, and a model of comfort. I
hope to be at Genoa on Thursday morning, and to find
your letter there. We have agreed to drop Sicily, and
to return home by way of Marseilles. Our projected time
for reaching London is the 10th of December.</p>

<p>As this house is full, I daresay we shall meet some
one we know at the table d'h&ocirc;te to-day. It is extraordinary
that the only travellers we have encountered,
since we left Paris, have been one horribly vapid Englishman
and wife whom we dropped at Basle, one boring
Englishman whom we found (and, thank God, left) at
Geneva, and two English maiden ladies, whom we found
sitting on a rock (with parasols) the day before yesterday,
in the most magnificent part of the Gorge of Gondo, the
most awful portion of the Simplon&mdash;there awaiting their
travelling chariot, in which, with their money, their parasols,
and a perfect shop of baskets, they were carefully <i>locked
up</i> by an English servant in sky blue and silver buttons.
We have been in the most extraordinary vehicles&mdash;like
swings, like boats, like Noah's arks, like barges and
enormous bedsteads. After dark last night, a landlord,
where we changed horses, discovered that the luggage
would certainly be stolen from <i>questo porco d'uno carro</i>&mdash;this
pig of a cart&mdash;his complimentary description of our
carriage, unless cords were attached to each of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
trunks, which cords were to hang down so that we
might hold them in our hands all the way, and feel
any tug that might be made at our treasures. You will
imagine the absurdity of our jolting along some twenty
miles in this way, exactly as if we were in three shower-baths
and were afraid to pull the string.</p>

<p>We are going to the Scala to-night, having got the
old box belonging to the hotel, the old key of which is
lying beside me on the table. There seem to be no
singers of note here now, and it appears for the time to
have fallen off considerably. I shall now bring this to
a close, hoping that I may have more interesting jottings
to send you about the old scenes and people, from Genoa,
where we shall stay two days. You are now, I take it,
at Macready's. I shall be greatly interested by your
account of your visit there. We often talk of you all.</p>

<p>Edward's Italian is (I fear) very weak. When we
began to get really into the language, he reminded me
of poor Roche in Germany. But he seems to have picked
up a little this morning. He has been unfortunate with
the unlucky Egg, leaving a pair of his shoes (his favourite
shoes) behind in Paris, and his flannel dressing-gown
yesterday morning at Domo d'Ossola. In all other
respects he is just as he was.</p>

<p>Egg and Collins have gone out to kill the lions here,
and I take advantage of their absence to write to you,
Georgie, and Miss Coutts. Wills will have told you, I
daresay, that Cerjat accompanied us on a miserably wet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
morning, in a heavy rain, down the lake. By-the-bye,
the wife of one of his cousins, born in France of German
parents, living in the next house to Haldimand's, is one
of the most charming, natural, open-faced, and delightful
women I ever saw. Madame de &mdash;&mdash; is set up as the
great attraction of Lausanne; but this capital creature
shuts her up altogether. We have called her (her&mdash;the
real belle), ever since, the early closing movement.</p>

<p>I am impatient for letters from home; confused
ideas are upon me that you are going to White's, but I
have no notion when.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself, and God bless you.</p>

<p>As we arrived here later than I had expected (in
consequence of the journey from Milan being most horribly
slow) I received your welcome letter only this morning.
I write this before going to bed, that I may be sure of
not being taken by any engagement off the post time
to-morrow.</p>

<p>We came in last night between seven and eight. The
railroad to Turin is finished and opened to within twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
miles of Genoa. Its effect upon the whole town, and
especially upon that part of it lying down beyond the
lighthouse and away by San Pietro d'Arena, is quite
wonderful. I only knew the place by the lighthouse, so
numerous were the new buildings, so wide the streets,
so busy the people, and so thriving and busy the many
signs of commerce. To-day I have seen &mdash;&mdash;, the &mdash;&mdash;,
the &mdash;&mdash;, and the &mdash;&mdash;, the latter of whom live at Nervi,
fourteen or fifteen miles off, towards Porto Fino. First,
of the &mdash;&mdash;. They are just the same, except that
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s face is larger and fuller, and her hair rather
gray. As I rang at their bell she came out walking,
and stared at me. "What! you don't know me?" said I;
upon which she recognised me very warmly, and then
said in her old quiet way: "I expected to find a ruin.
We heard you had been so ill; and I find you younger
and better-looking than ever. But it's so strange to see
you without a bright waistcoat. Why haven't you got
a bright waistcoat on?" I apologised for my black one,
and was sent upstairs, when &mdash;&mdash; presently appeared in
a hideous and demoniacal nightdress, having turned out
of bed to greet his distinguished countryman. After a
long talk, in the course of which I arranged to dine there
on Sunday early, before starting by the steamer for
Naples, and in which they told me every possible and
impossible particular about their minutest affairs, and
especially about &mdash;&mdash;'s marriage, I set off for &mdash;&mdash;, at &mdash;&mdash;.
I had found letters from him here, and he had been here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
over and over again, and had driven out no end of times
to the Gate to leave messages for me, and really is (in
his strange uncouth way) crying glad to see me. I found
him and his wife in a little comfortable country house,
overlooking the sea, sitting in a small summer-house on
wheels, exactly like a bathing machine. I found her
rather pretty, extraordinarily cold and composed, a mere
piece of furniture, <i>talking broken English</i>. Through eight
months in the year they live in this country place. She
never reads, never works, never talks, never gives an
order or directs anything, has only a taste for going to
the theatre (where she never speaks either) and buying
clothes. They sit in the garden all day, dine at four,
<i>smoke their cigars</i>, go in at eight, sit about till ten, and
then go to bed. The greater part of this I had from &mdash;&mdash;
himself in a particularly unintelligible confidence in the
garden, the only portion of which that I could clearly
understand were the words "and one thing and another,"
repeated one hundred thousand times. He described
himself as being perfectly happy, and seemed very fond
of his wife. "But that," said &mdash;&mdash; to me this morning,
looking like the figure-head of a ship, with a nutmeg-grater
for a face, "that he ought to be, and must be, and is bound
to be&mdash;he couldn't help it."</p>

<p>Then I went on to the &mdash;&mdash;'s, and found them living
in a beautiful situation in a ruinous Albaro-like palace.
Coming upon them unawares, I found &mdash;&mdash;, with a pointed
beard, smoking a great German pipe, in a pair of slippers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate,
in a singularly untidy state&mdash;one (heaven knows why!)
without stockings, and both with their little short hair
cropped in a manner never before beheld, and a little
bright bow stuck on the top of it. &mdash;&mdash; said she had
invented this headgear as a picturesque thing, adding
that perhaps it was&mdash;and perhaps it was not. She was
greatly flushed and agitated, but looked very well, and
seems to be greatly liked here. We had disturbed her
at her painting in oils, and I rather received an impression
that, what with that, and what with music, the

teaching the two little girls the multiplication table in a
disorderly old billiard-room with all manner of maps in it.</p>

<p>Having obtained a gracious permission from the lady
of the school, I am going to show my companions the
Sala of the Peschiere this morning. It is raining intensely
hard in the regular Genoa manner, so that I can hardly
hope for Genoa's making as fine an impression as I could
desire. Our boat for Naples is a large French mail boat,
and we hope to get there on Tuesday or Wednesday. If
the day after you receive this you write to the Poste
Restante, Rome, it will be the safest course. Friday's
letter write Poste Restante, Florence. You refer to a letter
you suppose me to have received from Forster&mdash;to whom
my love. No letter from him has come to hand.</p>

<p>I will resume my report of this place in my next.
In the meantime, I will not fail to drink dear Katey's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
health to-day. Edward has just come in with mention of
an English boat on Tuesday morning, superior to French
boat to-morrow, and faster. I shall inquire at &mdash;&mdash; and
take the best. When I next write I will give you our
route in detail.</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear of Mr. Robson's success in a
serious part, as I hope he will now be a fine actor. I
hope you will enjoy yourself at Macready's, though I
fear it must be sometimes but a melancholy visit.</p>

<p>Good-bye, my dear, and believe me ever most
affectionately.</p>


<div class='date'><br /><br /><i>Sunday, 30th October.</i></div>

<p>We leave for Naples to-morrow morning by the
Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer the <i>Valletta</i>.
I send a sketch of our movements that I have at last
been able to make.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; quite came out yesterday. So did Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
(in a different manner), by violently attacking Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; for
painting ill in oils when she might be playing well on the
piano. It rained hard all yesterday, but is finer this morning.
We went over the Peschiere in the wet afternoon.
The garden is sorely neglected now, and the rooms are
all full of boarding-school beds, and most of the fireplaces
are closed up, but the old beauty and grandeur of the place
were in it still.</p>

<p>This will find you, I suppose, at Sherborne. My
heartiest love to dear Macready, and to Miss Macready,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and to all the house. I hope my godson has not forgotten
me.</p>

<p>I will think of Charley (from whom I have heard
here) and soon write to him definitely. At present I think
he had better join me at Boulogne. I shall not bring
the little boys over, as, if we keep our time, it would be
too long before Christmas Day.</p>

<p>With love to Georgy, ever most affectionately yours.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Hotel des &Eacute;trangers, Naples</span>,</span><br />
<i>Friday Night, November 4th, 1853.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dearest Catherine</span>,</div>

<p>We arrived here at midday&mdash;two days after our
intended time, under circumstances which I reserve for
Georgina's letter, by way of variety&mdash;in what Forster
used to call good health and sp&mdash;p&mdash;pirits. We have
a charming apartment opposite the sea, a little lower
down than the Victoria&mdash;in the direction of the San
Carlo Theatre&mdash;and the windows are now wide open as on
an English summer night. The first persons we found
on board at Genoa, were Emerson Tennent, Lady Tennent,
their son and daughter. They are all here too, in an
apartment over ours, and we have all been constantly
together in a very friendly way, ever since our meeting.
We dine at the table <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'd'hote'">d'h&ocirc;te</ins>&mdash;made a league together on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
board&mdash;and have been mutually agreeable. They have
no servant with them, and have profited by Edward. He
goes on perfectly well, is always cheerful and ready, has
been sleeping on board (upside down, I believe), in a corner,
with his head in the wet and his heels against the side of
the paddle-box&mdash;but has been perpetually gay and fresh.</p>

<p>As soon as we got our luggage from the custom house,
we packed complete changes in a bag, set off in a carriage
for some warm baths, and had a most refreshing cleansing
after our long journey. There was an odd Neapolitan
attendant&mdash;a steady old man&mdash;who, bringing the linen
into my bath, proposed to "soap me." Upon which I
called out to the other two that I intended to have everything
done to me that could be done, and gave him
directions accordingly. I was frothed all over with Naples
soap, rubbed all down, scrubbed with a brush, had my
nails cut, and all manner of extraordinary operations performed.
He was as much disappointed (apparently) as
surprised not to find me dirty, and kept on ejaculating
under his breath, "Oh, Heaven! how clean this Englishman
is!" He also remarked that the Englishman is as
fair as a beautiful woman. Some relations of Lord John
Russell's, going to Malta, were aboardship, and we were
very pleasant. Likewise there was a Mr. Young aboard&mdash;an
agreeable fellow, not very unlike Forster in person&mdash;who
introduced himself as the brother of the Miss
Youngs whom we knew at Boulogne. He was musical
and had much good-fellowship in him, and we were very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
agreeable together also. On the whole I became decidedly
popular, and was embraced on all hands when I came
over the side this morning. We are going up Vesuvius,
of course, and to Herculaneum and Pompeii, and the
usual places. The Tennents will be our companions in
most of our excursions, but we shall leave them here
behind us. Naples looks just the same as when we left
it, except that the weather is much better and brighter.</p>

<p>On the day before we left Genoa, we had another
dinner with &mdash;&mdash; at his country place. He was the soul
of hospitality, and really seems to love me. You would
have been quite touched if you could have seen the honest
warmth of his affection. On the occasion of this second
banquet, Egg made a brilliant mistake that perfectly
convulsed us all. I had introduced all the games with
great success, and we were playing at the "What advice
would you have given that person?" game. The advice
was "Not to bully his fellow-creatures." Upon which,
Egg triumphantly and with the greatest glee, screamed,
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!" utterly forgetting &mdash;&mdash;'s relationship, which
I had elaborately impressed upon him. The effect was
perfectly irresistible and uncontrollable; and the little
woman's way of humouring the joke was in the best
taste and the best sense. While I am upon Genoa I may
add, that when we left the Croce the landlord, in hoping
that I was satisfied, told me that as I was an old inhabitant,
he had charged the prices "as to a Genoese."
They certainly were very reasonable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Sartoris have lately been staying in this
house, but are just gone. It is kept by an English
waiting-maid who married an Italian courier, and is
extremely comfortable and clean. I am getting impatient
to hear from you with all home news, and shall be heartily
glad to get to Rome, and find my best welcome and
interest at the post-office there.</p>

<p>That ridiculous &mdash;&mdash; and her mother were at the
hotel at Leghorn the day before yesterday, where the
mother (poor old lady!) was so ill from the fright and
anxiety consequent on her daughter's efforts at martyrdom,
that it is even doubtful whether she will recover. I learnt
from a lady friend of &mdash;&mdash;, that all this nonsense originated
at Nice, where she was stirred up by Free Kirk parsons&mdash;itinerant&mdash;any
one of whom I take her to be ready to
make a semi-celestial marriage with. The dear being
who told me all about her was a noble specimen&mdash;single,
forty, in a clinging flounced black silk dress, which
wouldn't drape, or bustle, or fall, or do anything of that
sort&mdash;and with a leghorn hat on her head, at least (I am
serious) <i>six feet round</i>. The consequence of its immense
size, was, that whereas it had an insinuating blue decoration
in the form of a bow in front, it was so out of her
knowledge behind, that it was all battered and bent in
that direction&mdash;and, viewed from that quarter, she looked
drunk.</p>

<p>My best love to Mamey and Katey, and Sydney the
king of the nursery, and Harry and the dear little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Plornishghenter. I kiss almost all the children I encounter
in remembrance of their sweet faces, and talk to all the
mothers who carry them. I hope to hear nothing but
good news from you, and to find nothing but good spirits
in your expected letter when I come to Rome. I already
begin to look homeward, being now at the remotest part
of the journey, and to anticipate the pleasure of return.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Miss King</span>,</div>

<p>I wish to get over the disagreeable part of my
letter in the beginning. I have great doubts of the
possibility of publishing your story in portions.</p>

<p>But I think it possesses <i>very great merit</i>. My doubts
arise partly from the nature of the interest which I fear
requires presentation as a whole, and partly on your
manner of relating the tale. The people do not sufficiently
work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic
action. You are too much their exponent; what you do
for them, they ought to do for themselves. With reference
to publication in detached portions (or, indeed, with a
reference to the force of the story in any form), that long
stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the
antecedents of the clergyman's biography, are rather
crippling. I may mention that I think the boy (the child
of the second marriage) a little too "slangy." I know
the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a character
in these times; but, considering his part in the story, I
regard it as the author's function to elevate such a characteristic,
and soften it into something more expressive of the
ardour and flush of youth, and its romance. It seems to
me, too, that the dialogues between the lady and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Italian maid are conventional but not natural. This
observation I regard as particularly applying to the maid,
and to the scene preceding the murder. Supposing the
main objection surmountable, I would venture then to
suggest to you the means of improvement in this respect.</p>

<p>The paper is so full of good touches of character,
passion, and natural emotion, that I very much wish for a
little time to reconsider it, and to try whether condensation
here and there would enable us to get it say into four parts.
I am not sanguine of this, for I observed the difficulties as
I read it the night before last; but I am very unwilling, I
assure you, to decline what has so much merit.</p>

<p>I am going to Paris on Sunday morning for ten days or
so. I purpose being back again within a fortnight. If
you will let me think of this matter in the meanwhile, I
shall at least have done all I can to satisfy my own
appreciation of your work.</p>

<p>But if, in the meantime, you should desire to have it
back with any prospect of publishing it through other
means, a letter&mdash;the shortest in the world&mdash;from you to
Mr. Wills at the "Household Words" office will immediately
produce it. I repeat with perfect sincerity that I
am much impressed by its merits, and that if I had read it
as the production of an entire stranger, I think it would
have made exactly this effect upon me.</p>

<p>I have gone carefully over your story again, and
quite agree with you that the episode of the clergyman
could be told in a very few lines. Startling as I know
it will appear to you, I am bound to say that I think
the purpose of the whole tale would be immensely
strengthened by great compression. I doubt if it could
not be told more forcibly in half the space.</p>

<p>It is certainly too long for "Household Words," and
I fear my idea of it is too short for you. I am, if possible,
more unwilling than I was at first to decline it; but the
more I have considered it, the longer it has seemed to
grow. Nor can I ask you to try to present it free from
that objection, because I already perceive the difficulty,
and pain, of such an effort.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, you are wrong about
the Lady at last, and to the best of my observation,
you do not express what you explain yourself to mean in the
case of the Italian attendant. I have met with such talk
in the romances of Maturin's time&mdash;certainly never in
Italian life.</p>

<p>These, however, are slight points easily to be compromised
in an hour. The great obstacle I must leave
wholly to your own judgment, in looking over the tale
again.</p>

<p>I have hope of Mr. Morley,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> whom one cannot see
without knowing to be a straightforward, earnest man.

I quite agree with you that they hardly know
what to be at; but it is an immensely difficult subject
to start, and they must have every allowance. At any
rate, it is not by leaving them alone and giving them
no help, that they can be urged on to success. (Travers,
too, I think, a man of the Anti-Corn-Law-League order.)</p>

<p>Higgins told me, after the meeting on Monday night,
that on the previous evening he had been closeted with
&mdash;&mdash;, whose letter in that day's paper he had put right
for <i>The Times</i>. He had never spoken to &mdash;&mdash; before, he
said, and found him a rather muddle-headed Scotchman
as to his powers of conveying his ideas. He (Higgins)
had gone over his documents judicially, and with the
greatest attention; and not only was &mdash;&mdash; wrong in every
particular (except one very unimportant circumstance),
but, in reading documents to the House, had stopped
short in sentences where no stop was, and by so doing
had utterly perverted their meaning.</p>

<p>This is to come out, of course, when said &mdash;&mdash; gets
the matter on. I thought the case so changed, before I
knew this, by his letter and that of the other shipowners,
that I told Morley, when I went down to the theatre,
that I felt myself called upon to relieve him from the
condition I had imposed.</p>

<p>For the rest, I am quite calmly confident that I only
do justice to the strength of my opinions, and use the
power which circumstances have given me, conscientiously
and moderately, with a right object, and towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
prevention of nameless miseries. I should be now reproaching
myself if I had not gone to the meeting, and,
having been, I am very glad.</p>

<p>A good illustration of a Government office. &mdash;&mdash; very
kindly wrote to me to suggest that "Houses of Parliament"
illustration. After I had dined on Wednesday,
and was going to jog slowly down to Drury Lane, it
suddenly came into my head that perhaps his details
were wrong. I had just time to turn to the "Annual
Register," and <i>not one of them was correct!</i></p>

<p>This is, of course, in close confidence.</p>

<p>A necessity is upon me now&mdash;as at most times&mdash;of
wandering about in my old wild way, to think. I could
no more resist this on Sunday or yesterday than a man
can dispense with food, or a horse can help himself
from being driven. I hold my inventive capacity on
the stern condition that it must master my whole life,
often have complete possession of me, make its own
demands upon me, and sometimes, for months together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
put everything else away from me. If I had not known
long ago that my place could never be held, unless I
were at any moment ready to devote myself to it entirely,
I should have dropped out of it very soon. All this I
can hardly expect you to understand&mdash;or the restlessness
and waywardness of an author's mind. You have never
seen it before you, or lived with it, or had occasion to
think or care about it, and you cannot have the necessary
consideration for it. "It is only half-an-hour,"&mdash;"It is
only an afternoon,"&mdash;"It is only an evening," people say
to me over and over again; but they don't know that it
is impossible to command one's self sometimes to any
stipulated and set disposal of five minutes,&mdash;or that the
mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes
worry a whole day. These are the penalties paid for
writing books. Whoever is devoted to an art must be
content to deliver himself wholly up to it, and to find
his recompense in it. I am grieved if you suspect me
of not wanting to see you, but I can't help it; I must
go my way whether or no.</p>

<p>I thought you would understand that in sending the
card for the box I sent an assurance that there was
nothing amiss. I am pleased to find that you were all
so interested with the play. My ladies say that the first
part is too painful and wants relief. I have been going
to see it a dozen times, but have never seen it yet, and
never may. Madame C&eacute;leste is injured thereby (you see

<p>It is like a breath of fresh spring air to know that
that unfortunate baby of yours is out of her one close
room, and has about half-a-pint of very doubtful air per
day. I could only have become her Godfather on the
condition that she had five hundred gallons of open air
at any rate every day of her life; and you would soon
see a rose or two in the face of my other little friend,
Ella, if you opened all your doors and windows throughout
the whole of all fine weather, from morning to night.</p>

<p>I am going off; I don't know where or how far, to
ponder about I don't know what. Sometimes I am half
in the mood to set off for France, sometimes I think I
will go and walk about on the seashore for three or
four months, sometimes I look towards the Pyrenees,
sometimes Switzerland. I made a compact with a great
Spanish authority last week, and vowed I would go
to Spain. Two days afterwards Layard and I agreed
to go to Constantinople when Parliament rises. To-morrow

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Winter</span>,</div>

<p>I am truly grieved to hear of your affliction in
the loss of your darling baby. But if you be not, even
already, so reconciled to the parting from that innocent
child for a little while, as to bear it gently and with a
softened sorrow, I know that that not unhappy state of
mind must soon arise. The death of infants is a release
from so much chance and change&mdash;from so many casualties
and distresses&mdash;and is a thing so beautiful in its serenity
and peace&mdash;that it should not be a bitterness, even in a
mother's heart. The simplest and most affecting passage
in all the noble history of our Great Master, is His consideration
for little children, and in reference to yours,
as many millions of bereaved mothers poor and rich will
do in reference to theirs until the end of time, you may
take the comfort of the generous words, "And He took
a child, and set it in the midst of them."</p>

<p>In a book, by one of the greatest English writers,
called "A Journey from this World to the Next," a parent
comes to the distant country beyond the grave, and finds
the little girl he had lost so long ago, engaged in building
a bower to receive him in, when his aged steps should
bring him there at last. He is filled with joy to see her,
so young&mdash;so bright&mdash;so full of promise&mdash;and is enraptured
to think that she never was old, wan, tearful,
withered. This is always one of the sources of consolation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in the deaths of children. With no effort of the fancy,
with nothing to undo, you will always be able to think of
the pretty creature you have lost, <i>as a child</i> in heaven.</p>

<p>A poor little baby of mine lies in Highgate cemetery&mdash;and
I laid her just as you think of laying yours, in the
catacombs there, until I made a resting-place for all of
us in the free air.</p>

<p>It is better that I should not come to see you. I
feel quite sure of that, and will think of you instead.</p>

<p>God bless and comfort you! Mrs. Dickens and her
sister send their kindest condolences to yourself and
Mr. Winter. I add mine with all my heart.</p>

<p>I don't know whether you may have heard from
Webster, or whether the impression I derived from Mark's
manner on Friday may be altogether correct. But it
strongly occurred to me that Webster was going to decline
the play, and that he really has worried himself into a fear
of playing Aaron.</p>

<p>Now, when I got this into my head&mdash;which was during
the rehearsal&mdash;I considered two things:&mdash;firstly, how we
could best put about the success of the piece more widely
and extensively even than it has yet reached; and secondly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
how you could be best assisted against a bad production
of it hereafter, or no production of it. I thought I saw
immediately, that the point would be to have this representation
noticed in the newspapers. So I waited until
the rehearsal was over and we had profoundly astonished
the family, and then asked Colonel Waugh what he thought
of sending some cards for Tuesday to the papers. He
highly approved, and I yesterday morning directed Mitchell
to send to all the morning papers, and to some of the
weekly ones&mdash;a dozen in the whole.</p>

<p>I dined at Lord John's yesterday (where Meyerbeer was,
and said to me after dinner: "Ah, mon ami illustre! que
c'est noble de vous entendre parler d'haute voix morale, &agrave; la
table d'un ministre!" for I gave them a little bit of truth
about Sunday that was like bringing a Sebastopol battery
among the polite company), I say, after this long parenthesis,
I dined at Lord John's, and found great interest and
talk about the play, and about what everybody who had
been here had said of it. And I was confirmed in my decision
that the thing for you was the invitation to the papers.
Hence I write to tell you what I have done.</p>

<p>I dine at home at half-past five if you are disengaged,

<p>Your manuscript, entitled a "Wife's Story," has
come under my own perusal within these last three or
four days. I recognise in it such great merit and unusual
promise, and I think it displays so much power and
knowledge of the human heart, that I feel a strong
interest in you as its writer.</p>

<p>I have begged the gentleman, who is in my confidence
as to the transaction of the business of "Household
Words," to return the MS. to you by the post, which
(as I hope) will convey this note to you. My object is
this: I particularly entreat you to consider the catastrophe.
You write to be read, of course. The close of
the story is unnecessarily painful&mdash;will throw off numbers
of persons who would otherwise read it, and who (as it
stands) will be deterred by hearsay from so doing, and
is so tremendous a piece of severity, that it will defeat
your purpose. All my knowledge and experience, such
as they are, lead me straight to the recommendation that
you will do well to spare the life of the husband, and
of one of the children. Let her suppose the former
dead, from seeing him brought in wounded and insensible&mdash;lose
nothing of the progress of her mental suffering
afterwards when that doctor is in attendance upon her&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
bring her round at last to the blessed surprise that
her husband is still living, and that a repentance which
can be worked out, <i>in the way of atonement for the misery
she has occasioned to the man whom she so ill repaid for
his love, and made so miserable</i>, lies before her. So will
you soften the reader whom you now as it were harden,
and so you will bring tears from many eyes, which can
only have their spring in affectionately and gently touched
hearts. I am perfectly certain that with this change, all
the previous part of your tale will tell for twenty times
as much as it can in its present condition. And it is
because I believe you have a great fame before you if
you do justice to the remarkable ability you possess, that
I venture to offer you this advice in what I suppose to
be the beginning of your career.</p>

<p>I observe some parts of the story which would be
strengthened, even in their psychological interest, by condensation
here and there. If you will leave that to me,
I will perform the task as conscientiously and carefully
as if it were my own. But the suggestion I offer for
your acceptance, no one but yourself can act upon.</p>

<p>Let me conclude this hasty note with the plain assurance
that I have never been so much surprised and
struck by any manuscript I have read, as I have been
by yours.</p>

<p>I did not enter, in detail, on the spirit of the alteration
I propose in your story; because I thought it right
that you should think out that for yourself if you applied
yourself to the change. I can now assure you that you
describe it exactly as I had conceived it; and if I had
wanted anything to confirm me in my conviction of its
being right, our both seeing it so precisely from the same
point of view, would be ample assurance to me.</p>

<p>I would leave her new and altered life to be inferred.
It does not appear to me either necessary or practicable

<p>I have received a letter signed by you (which I
assume to be written mainly on behalf of what are called
Working-Men and their families) inviting me to attend a
meeting in our Parish Vestry Hall this evening on the
subject of the stoppage of the Sunday bands in the Parks.</p>

<p>I thoroughly agree with you that those bands have
afforded an innocent and healthful enjoyment on the
Sunday afternoon, to which the people have a right.
But I think it essential that the working people should,
of themselves and by themselves, assert that right.
They have been informed, on the high authority of
their first Minister (lately rather in want of House of
Commons votes I am told) that they are almost indifferent
to it. The correction of that mistake, if official omniscience
can be mistaken, lies with themselves. In case
it should be considered by the meeting, which I prefer
for this reason not to attend, expedient to unite with
other Metropolitan parishes in forming a fund for the
payment of such expenses as may be incurred in peaceably
and numerously representing to the governing powers
that the harmless recreation they have taken away is
very much wanted, I beg you to put down my name as
a subscriber of ten pounds.</p>

<p>If you knew how often I write to you individually
and personally in my books, you would be no more
surprised in seeing this note than you were in seeing
me do my duty by that flowery julep (in what I dreamily
apprehend to have been a former state of existence) at
Baltimore.</p>

<p>Will you let me present to you a cousin of mine,
Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, who is associated with a merchant's house
in New York? Of course he wants to see you, and
know you. How can <i>I</i> wonder at that? How can
anybody?</p>

<p>I had a long talk with Leslie at the last Academy
dinner (having previously been with him in Paris), and
he told me that you were flourishing. I suppose you
know that he wears a moustache&mdash;so do I for the matter
of that, and a beard too&mdash;and that he looks like a portrait
of Don Quixote.</p>

<p>Holland House has four-and-twenty youthful pages
in it now&mdash;twelve for my lord, and twelve for my lady;
and no clergyman coils his leg up under his chair all
dinner-time, and begins to uncurve it when the hostess
goes. No wheeled chair runs smoothly in with that
beaming face in it; and &mdash;&mdash;'s little cotton pocket-handkerchief

all I will sully it with. You know, I daresay, that for
a year or so before his death he wandered, and lost
himself like one of the Children in the Wood, grown
up there and grown down again. He had Mrs. Procter
and Mrs. Carlyle to breakfast with him one morning&mdash;only
those two. Both excessively talkative, very quick
and clever, and bent on entertaining him. When Mrs.
Carlyle had flashed and shone before him for about
three-quarters of an hour on one subject, he turned his
poor old eyes on Mrs. Procter, and pointing to the brilliant
discourser with his poor old finger, said (indignantly),
"Who is <i>she?</i>" Upon this, Mrs. Procter, cutting in,
delivered (it is her own story) a neat oration on the life
and writings of Carlyle, and enlightened him in her
happiest and airiest manner; all of which he heard,
staring in the dreariest silence, and then said (indignantly,
as before), "And who are <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>I thought Wills had told you as to the Guild
(for I begged him to) that he can do absolutely nothing
until our charter is seven years old. It is the stringent
and express prohibition of the Act of Parliament&mdash;for
which things you members, thank God, are responsible
and not I. When I observed this clause (which was
just as we were going to grant a pension, if we could
agree on a good subject), I caused our Counsel's opinion
to be taken on it, and there is not a doubt about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I immediately recommended that there should be no
expenses&mdash;that the interest on the capital should be all
invested as it accrued&mdash;that the chambers should be
given up and the clerk discharged&mdash;and that the Guild
should have the use of the "Household Words" office
rent free, and the services of Wills on the same terms.
All of which was done.</p>

<p>A letter is now copying, to be sent round to all the
members, explaining, with the New Year, the whole state
of the thing. You will receive this. It appears to me
that it looks wholesome enough. But if a strong idiot
comes and binds your hands, or mine, or both, for
seven years, what is to be done against him?</p>

<p>As to greater matters than this, however&mdash;as to
all matters on this teeming Earth&mdash;it appears to me that
the House of Commons and Parliament altogether, is
just the dreariest failure and nuisance that has bothered
this much-bothered world.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Madam</span>,</div>

<p>As I am away from London for a few days, your
letter has been forwarded to me.</p>

<p>I can honestly encourage and assure you that I believe
the depression and want of confidence under which you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
describe yourself as labouring to have no sufficient
foundation.</p>

<p>First as to "Mr. Arle." I have constantly heard it spoken
of with great approval, and I think it a book of considerable
merit. If I were to tell you that I see no evidence
of inexperience in it, that would not be true. I think
a little more stir and action to be desired also; but I am
surprised by your being despondent about it, for I assure
you that I had supposed it (always remembering that
it is your first novel) to have met with a very good
reception.</p>

<p>I can bring to my memory&mdash;here, with no means of
reference at hand&mdash;only two papers of yours that have
been unsuccessful at "Household Words." I think the
first was called "The Brook." It appeared to me to
break down upon a confusion that pervaded it, between
a Coroner's Inquest and a Trial. I have a general recollection
of the mingling of the two, as to facts and forms
that should have been kept apart, in some inextricable
manner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement.
The second was about a wife's writing a Novel and
keeping the secret from her husband until it was done.
I did not think the incident of sufficient force to justify
the length of the narrative. But there is nothing fatal
in either of these mischances.</p>

<p>Mr. Wills told me when I spoke to him of the latter
paper that you had it in contemplation to offer a longer
story to "Household Words." If you should do so, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
assure you I shall be happy to read it myself, and that
I shall have a sincere desire to accept it, if possible.</p>

<p>I can give you no better counsel than to look into
the life about you, and to strive for what is noblest and
true. As to further encouragement, I do not, I can most
strongly add, believe that you have any reason to be
downhearted.</p>

<span class="smcap">Tavistock House</span>, <i>Saturday Morning, 30th May, 1857.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Madam</span>,</div>

<p>I read your story, with all possible attention, last
night. I cannot tell you with what reluctance I write to
you respecting it, for my opinion of it is <i>not</i> favourable,
although I perceive your heart in it, and great strength.</p>

<p>Pray understand that I claim no infallibility. I merely
express my own honest opinion, formed against my earnest
desire. I do not lay it down as law for others, though,
of course, I believe that many others would come to
the same conclusion. It appears to me that the story is
one that cannot possibly be told within the compass to
which you have limited yourself. The three principal
people are, every one of them, in the wrong with the
reader, and you cannot put any of them right, without
making the story extend over a longer space of time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and without anatomising the souls of the actors more
slowly and carefully. Nothing would justify the departure
of Alice, but her having some strong reason to
believe that in taking that step, <i>she saved her lover</i>. In
your intentions as to that lover's transfer of his affections
to Eleanor, I descry a striking truth; but I think
it confusedly wrought out, and all but certain to fail in
expressing itself. Eleanor, I regard as forced and overstrained.
The natural result is, that she carries a train
of anti-climax after her. I particularly notice this at
the point when she thinks she is going to be drowned.</p>

<p>The whole idea of the story is sufficiently difficult to
require the most exact truth and the greatest knowledge
and skill in the colouring throughout. In this respect
I have no doubt of its being extremely defective. The
people do not talk as such people would; and the little
subtle touches of description which, by making the
country house and the general scene real, would give
an air of reality to the people (much to be desired) are
altogether wanting. The more you set yourself to the
illustration of your heroine's passionate nature, the more
indispensable this attendant atmosphere of truth becomes.
It would, in a manner, oblige the reader to believe in her.
Whereas, for ever exploding like a great firework without
any background, she glares and wheels and hisses, and
goes out, and has lighted nothing.</p>

<p>Lastly, I fear she is too convulsive from beginning
to end. Pray reconsider, from this point of view, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
brow, and her eyes, and her drawing herself up to her
full height, and her being a perfumed presence, and her
floating into rooms, also her asking people how they
dare, and the like, on small provocation. When she
hears her music being played, I think she is particularly
objectionable.</p>

<p>I have a strong belief that if you keep this story by
you three or four years, you will form an opinion of it
not greatly differing from mine. There is so much good
in it, so much reflection, so much passion and earnestness,
that, if my judgment be right, I feel sure you will come
over to it. On the other hand, I do not think that its
publication, as it stands, would do you service, or be
agreeable to you hereafter.</p>

<p>I have no means of knowing whether you are patient
in the pursuit of this art; but I am inclined to think
that you are not, and that you do not discipline yourself
enough. When one is impelled to write this or that, one
has still to consider: "How much of this will tell for
what I mean? How much of it is my own wild emotion
and superfluous energy&mdash;how much remains that is truly
belonging to this ideal character and these ideal circumstances?"
It is in the laborious struggle to make this
distinction, and in the determination to try for it, that
the road to the correction of faults lies. [Perhaps I
may remark, in support of the sincerity with which I
write this, that I am an impatient and impulsive person
myself, but that it has been for many years the constant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
effort of my life to practise at my desk what I
preach to you.]</p>

<p>I should not have written so much, or so plainly, but
for your last letter to me. It seems to demand that I
should be strictly true with you, and I am so in this letter,
without any reservation either way.</p>

not my present intention to give you the trouble of reading
anything like a letter, but I <span class="smcap">must</span> send you my loving word;
and tell you how we all think of you.</p>

<p>And here am I going off to-morrow to that meeting at
Manchester without <i>you!</i> the wildest and most impossible

back by Coventry, on Saturday, to receive the chronometer&mdash;also
without you!</p>

<p>If you don't get perfectly well soon, my dear old

to tell Olliffe (give him my love, and the same for Lady
Olliffe) what a Blessing he is.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how much pleasure I have derived
from the receipt of your earnest letter. Do not suppose
it possible that such praise can be "less than nothing" to
your old manager. It is more than all else.</p>

<p>Here in my little country house on the summit of the

to me in the most appropriate and delightful manner.
When the story can be read all at once, and my meaning
can be better seen, I will send it to you (sending it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

every morning station in their ever-green place at my

less constant than these, for they are with me through the

<p>Lord! to think of the bygone day when you were
stricken mute (was it not at Glasgow?) and, being mounted
on a tall ladder at a practicable window, stared at Forster,

<i>Friday Night, Feb. 3, 1860.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Chorley</span>,</div>

<p>I can most honestly assure you that I think
"Roccabella" a very remarkable book indeed. Apart&mdash;quite
apart&mdash;from my interest in you, I am certain that
if I had taken it up under any ordinarily favourable circumstances
as a book of which I knew nothing whatever,
I should not&mdash;could not&mdash;have relinquished it until I had
read it through. I had turned but a few pages, and come
to the shadow on the bright sofa at the foot of the bed,
when I knew myself to be in the hands of an artist. That
rare and delightful recognition I never lost for a moment
until I closed the second volume at the end. I am "a good
audience" when I have reason to be, and my girls would
testify to you, if there were need, that I cried over it
heartily. Your story seems to me remarkably ingenious.
I had not the least idea of the purport of the sealed
paper until you chose to enlighten me; and then I felt it
to be quite natural, quite easy, thoroughly in keeping with
the character and presentation of the Liverpool man. The
position of the Bell family in the story has a special air of
nature and truth; is quite new to me, and is so dexterously
and delicately done that I find the deaf daughter no less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
real and distinct than the clergyman's wife. The turn of
the story round that damnable Princess I pursued with a
pleasure with which I could pursue nothing but a true
interest; and I declare to you that if I were put upon
finding anything better than the scene of Roccabella's
death, I should stare round my bookshelves very much at
a loss for a long time. Similarly, your characters have
really surprised me. From the lawyer to the Princess, I
swear to them as true; and in your fathoming of Rosamond
altogether, there is a profound wise knowledge that I admire
and respect with a heartiness not easily overstated in words.</p>

<p>I am not quite with you as to the Italians. Your
knowledge of the Italian character seems to me surprisingly
subtle and penetrating; but I think we owe it to those most
unhappy men and their political wretchedness to ask ourselves
mercifully, whether their faults are not essentially
the faults of a people long oppressed and priest-ridden;&mdash;whether
their tendency to slink and conspire is not a
tendency that spies in every dress, from the triple crown to
a lousy head, have engendered in their ancestors through
generations? Again, like you, I shudder at the distresses
that come of these unavailing risings; my blood runs
hotter, as yours does, at the thought of the leaders safe,
and the instruments perishing by hundreds; yet what is
to be done? Their wrongs are so great that they <i>will</i>
rise from time to time somehow. It would be to doubt
the eternal providence of God to doubt that they will
rise successfully at last. Unavailing struggles against a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
dominant tyranny precede all successful turning against
it. And is it not a little hard in us Englishman, whose
forefathers have risen so often and striven against so much,
to look on, in our own security, through microscopes, and
detect the motes in the brains of men driven mad? Think,
if you and I were Italians, and had grown from boyhood to
our present time, menaced in every day through all these
years by that infernal confessional, dungeons, and soldiers,
could we be better than these men? Should we be so
good? I should not, I am afraid, if I know myself. Such
things would make of me a moody, bloodthirsty, implacable
man, who would do anything for revenge; and if I compromised
the truth&mdash;put it at the worst, habitually&mdash;where
should I ever have had it before me? In the old Jesuits'
college at Genoa, on the Chiaja at Naples, in the churches
of Rome, at the University of Padua, on the Piazzo San
Marco at Venice, where? And the government is in all
these places, and in all Italian places. I have seen something
of these men. I have known Mazzini and Gallenga;
Manin was tutor to my daughters in Paris; I have had long
talks about scores of them with poor Ary Scheffer, who was
their best friend. I have gone back to Italy after ten
years, and found the best men I had known there exiled or
in jail. I believe they have the faults you ascribe to them
(nationally, not individually), but I could not find it in my
heart, remembering their miseries, to exhibit those faults
without referring them back to their causes. You will
forgive my writing this, because I write it exactly as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
write my cordial little tribute to the high merits of your
book. If it were not a living reality to me, I should care
nothing about this point of disagreement; but you are far
too earnest a man, and far too able a man, to be left
unremonstrated with by an admiring reader. You cannot
write so well without influencing many people. If you
could tell me that your book had but twenty readers, I
would reply, that so good a book will influence more
people's opinions, through those twenty, than a worthless
book would through twenty thousand; and I express this
with the perfect confidence of one in whose mind the book
has taken, for good and all, a separate and distinct place.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the pleasure you have given me.
The poor acknowledgment of testifying to that pleasure
wherever I go will be my pleasure in return. And so, my
dear Chorley, good night, and God bless you.</p>

important business engagements at the "All the Year

forego. I charged them to tell you so, and was going to
write to you when I found your kind letter.</p>

<p>Thanks for your paper, which I have sent to the

<p>I know you will readily believe that I would come if I
could, and that I am heartily sorry I cannot.</p>

<p>A new story of my writing, nine months long, is just
begun in "All the Year Round." A certain allotment of
my time when I have that story-demand upon me, has,
all through my author life, been an essential condition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
my health and success. I have just returned here to work
so many hours every day for so many days. It is really
impossible for me to break my bond.</p>

<p>There is not a man in England who is more earnestly
your friend and admirer than I am. The conviction that
you know it, helps me out through this note. You are a
man of so much mark to me, that I even regret your
going into the House of Commons&mdash;for which assembly I
have but a scant respect. But I would not mention it to
the Southwark electors if I could come to-morrow; though
I should venture to tell them (and even that your friends
would consider very impolitic) that I think them very much
honoured by having such a candidate for their suffrages.</p>

<p>My daughter and sister-in-law want to know what you
have done with your "pledge" to come down here again.
If they had votes for Southwark they would threaten to
oppose you&mdash;but would never do it. I was solemnly sworn
at breakfast to let you know that we should be delighted to
see you. Bear witness that I kept my oath.</p>

men as if they had swum across with it. I have
already told &mdash;&mdash; what I am very well assured of concerning
you, but you are such a noble fellow that I must not
pursue that subject. But you will at least take my cordial
and affectionate thanks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have a touch of most
beautiful weather here now, and this country is most
beautiful too. I wish I could carry you off to a favourite
spot of mine between this and Maidstone, where I often
smoke your cigars and think of you. We often take our
lunch on a hillside there in the summer, and then I lie
down on the grass&mdash;a splendid example of laziness&mdash;and
say, "Now for my Morgan!"</p>

<p>My daughter and her aunt declare that they know
the true scent of the true article (which I don't in the least
believe), and sometimes they exclaim, "That's not a
Morgan," and the worst of it is they were once right by
accident.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope you will have seen the Christmas

<p>I am truly sorry that I cannot have the pleasure of
dining with you on Thursday. Although I consider
myself quite well, and although my doctor almost admits
the fact when I indignantly tax him with it, I am not
discharged. His treatment renders him very fearful that I
should take cold in going to and fro; and he makes
excuses, therefore (as I darkly suspect), for keeping me
here until said treatment is done with. This morning he
tells me he must see me "once more, on Wednesday." As
he has said the like for a whole week, my confidence is not
blooming enough at this present writing to justify me in
leaving a possibility of Banquo's place at your table.
Hence this note. It is screwed out of me.</p>

<p>My story will finish in the first week in August.
Yours ought to begin in the last week of July, or the
last week but one. Wilkie Collins will be at work to
follow you. The publication has made a very great success
with "Great Expectations," and could not present a finer

<p>Of the misgiving you entertain I cannot of course
judge until you give me leave to rush to the perusal. I
swear that I never thought I had half so much self-denial
as I have shown in this case! I think I shall
come out at Exeter Hall as a choice vessel on the strength
of it. In the meanwhile I have quickened the printer
and told him to get on fast.</p>

<p>You cannot think how happy you make me by what

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I received your revised proofs only yesterday, and
I sat down to read them last night. And before I say
anything further I may tell you that I <span class="smcap">could not</span> lay
them aside, but was obliged to go on with them in my
bedroom until I got into a very ghostly state indeed.
This morning I have taken them again and have gone
through them with the utmost attention.</p>

<p>Of the beauty and power of the writing I say not a
word, or of its originality and boldness, or of its quite
extraordinary constructive skill. I confine myself solely
to your misgiving, and to the question whether there
is any sufficient foundation for it.</p>

<p>On the last head I say, without the faintest hesitation,
most decidedly there is NOT sufficient foundation for
it. I do not share it in the least. I believe that the
readers who have here given their minds (or perhaps
had any to give) to those strange psychological mysteries
in ourselves, of which we are all more or less conscious,
will accept your wonders as curious weapons in the armoury
of fiction, and will submit themselves to the Art with which
said weapons are used. Even to that class of intelligence
the marvellous addresses itself from a very strong position;
and that class of intelligence is not accustomed to find the
marvellous in such very powerful hands as yours. On
more imaginative readers the tale will fall (or I am greatly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
mistaken) like a spell. By readers who combine some
imagination, some scepticism, and some knowledge and
learning, I hope it will be regarded as full of strange
fancy and curious study, startling reflections of their own
thoughts and speculations at odd times, and wonder which
a master has a right to evoke. In the last point lies, to
my thinking, the whole case. If you were the Magician's
servant instead of the Magician, these potent spirits would
get the better of you; but you <i>are</i> the Magician, and they
don't, and you make them serve your purpose.</p>

<p>Occasionally in the dialogue I see an expression here
and there which might&mdash;always solely with a reference
to your misgiving&mdash;be better away; and I think that
the vision, to use the word for want of a better&mdash;in the
museum, should be made a little less abstruse. I should
not say that, if the sale of the journal was below the sale
of <i>The Times</i> newspaper; but as it is probably several
thousands higher, I do. I would also suggest that after
the title we put the two words&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Romance</span>. It is
an absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving
with the blockheads, but I think it would be an effective
one. I don't, on looking at it, like the title. Here are
a few that have occurred to me.</p>

<p>"The Steel Casket."</p>

<p>"The Lost Manuscript."</p>

<p>"Derval Court."</p>

<p>"Perpetual Youth."</p>

<p>"Maggie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. Fenwick."</p>

<p>"Life and Death."</p>

<p>The four last I think the best. There is an objection
to "Dr. Fenwick" because there has been "Dr. Antonio,"
and there is a book of Dumas' which repeats the objection.
I don't think "Fenwick" startling enough. It appears to
me that a more startling title would take the (John) Bull
by the horns, and would be a serviceable concession to
your misgiving, as suggesting a story off the stones of
the gas-lighted Brentford Road.</p>

<p>The title is the first thing to be settled, and cannot be
settled too soon.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the weekly publication the divisions
of the story will often have to be greatly changed, though
afterwards, in the complete book, you can, of course,
divide it into chapters, free from that reference. For
example: I would end the first chapter on the third slip
at "and through the ghostly streets, under the ghostly
moon, went back to my solitary room." The rest of what
is now your first chapter might be made Chapter II.,
and would end the first weekly part.</p>

<p>I think I have become, by dint of necessity and practice,
rather cunning in this regard; and perhaps you
would not mind my looking closely to such points from
week to week. It so happens that if you had written
the opening of this story expressly for the occasion its
striking incidents could not possibly have followed one
another better. One other merely mechanical change I
suggest now. I would not have an initial letter for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
town, but would state in the beginning that I gave the
town a fictitious name. I suppose a blank or a dash
rather fends a good many people off&mdash;because it always
has that effect upon me.</p>

<p>Be sure that I am perfectly frank and open in all I
have said in this note, and that I have not a grain of
reservation in my mind. I think the story a very fine
one, one that no other man could write, and that there
is no strength in your misgiving for the two reasons:
firstly, that the work is professedly a work of Fancy
and Fiction, in which the reader is not required against
his will to take everything for Fact; secondly, that it is
written by the man who can write it. The Magician's
servant does not know what to do with the ghost, and
has, consequently, no business with him. The Magician
does know what to do with him, and has all the business
with him that he can transact.</p>

<p>I am quite at ease on the points that you have expressed
yourself as not at ease upon. Quite. I cannot too often
say that if they were carried on weak shoulders they would
break the bearer down. But in your mastering of them
lies the mastery over the reader.</p>

<p>This will reach you at Knebworth, I hope, to-morrow
afternoon. Pray give your doubts to the winds of that
high spot, and believe that if I had them I would swarm
up the flag-staff quite as nimbly as Margrave and nail the
Fenwick colours to the top.</p>

Ever affectionately yours.

<p>I did not read from Australia till the end, because
I was obliged to be hard at work that day, and thought
it best that the MS. should come back to you rather than
that I should detain it. Of course, I <i>can</i> read it, whenever
it suits you. As to Isabel's dying and Fenwick's
growing old, I would say that, beyond question, whatever
the meaning of the story tends to, is the proper end.</p>

<p>All the alterations you mention in your last, are
excellent.</p>

<p>As to title, "Margrave, a Tale of Mystery," would
be sufficiently striking. I prefer "Wonder" to "Mystery,"
because I think it suggests something higher
and more apart from ordinary complications of plot, or
the like, which "Mystery" might seem to mean. Will
you kindly remark that the title <span class="smcap">presses</span>, and that it will

<p>I have run away to this sea-beach to get rid of
my neuralgic face.</p>

<p>Touching the kind invitations received from you this
morning, I feel that the only course I can take&mdash;without
being a Humbug&mdash;is to decline them. After the middle
of June I shall be mostly at Gad's Hill&mdash;I know that
I cannot do better than keep out of the way of hot
rooms and late dinners, and what would you think of
me, or call me, if I were to accept and not come!</p>

<p>No, no, no. Be still my soul. Be virtuous, eminent
author. Do <i>not</i> accept, my Dickens. She is to come
to Gad's Hill with her spouse. Await her <i>there</i>, my
child. (Thus the voice of wisdom.)</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Gibson</span>,</div>

<p>I want very affectionately and earnestly to congratulate
you on your eldest daughter's approaching marriage.
Up to the moment when Mary told me of it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I had foolishly thought of her always as the pretty
little girl with the frank loving face whom I saw last on
the sands at Broadstairs. I rubbed my eyes and woke
at the words "going to be married," and found I had
been walking in my sleep some years.</p>

<p>I want to thank you also for thinking of me on the
occasion, but I feel that I am better away from it. I
should really have a misgiving that I was a sort of
shadow on a young marriage, and you will understand
me when I say so, and no more.</p>

<p>But I shall be with you in the best part of myself,
in the warmth of sympathy and friendship&mdash;and I send
my love to the dear girl, and devoutly hope and believe
that she will be happy. The face that I remember with
perfect accuracy, and could draw here, if I could draw
at all, was made to be happy and to make a husband so.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you ever travel by railroad in these
times! I wish Mary could tempt you to come by any
road to this little place.</p>

it&mdash;and even more than delighted by what you say of
our working in company.</p>

<p>Not one dissentient voice has reached me respecting
it. Through the dullest time of the year we held our
circulation most gallantly. And it could not have taken
a better hold. I saw Forster on Friday (newly returned
from thousands of provincial lunatics), and he really was
more impressed than I can tell you by what he had seen
of it. Just what you say you think it will turn out
to be, <i>he</i> was saying, almost in the same words.</p>

<p>I am burning to get at the whole story;&mdash;and you
inflame me in the maddest manner by your references
to what I don't know. The exquisite art with which
you have changed it, and have overcome the difficulties
of the mode of publication, has fairly staggered me. I

<p>I have read here, this evening, very attentively,
Nos. 19 and 20. I have not the least doubt of the introduced
matter; whether considered for its policy, its beauty,
or its wise bearing on the story, it is decidedly a great
improvement. It is at once very suggestive and very new
to have these various points of view presented to the
reader's mind.</p>

<p>That the audience is good enough for anything that is
well presented to it, I am quite sure.</p>

<p>When you can avoid <i>notes</i>, however, and get their
substance into the text, it is highly desirable in the case
of so large an audience, simply because, as so large an
audience necessarily reads the story in small portions, it
is of the greater importance that they should retain as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
much of its argument as possible. Whereas the difficulty
of getting numbers of people to read notes (which they
invariably regard as interruptions of the text, not as
strengtheners or elucidators of it) is wonderful.</p>

<i>Friday, Twenty-fourth January, 1862.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I have considered your questions, and here follow
my replies.</p>

<p>1. I think you undoubtedly <i>have</i> the right to forbid
the turning of your play into an opera.</p>

<p>2. I do <i>not</i> think the production of such an opera in the
slightest degree likely to injure the play or to render it a
less valuable property than it is now. If it could have any
effect on so standard and popular a work as "The Lady of
Lyons," the effect would, in my judgment, be beneficial.
But I believe the play to be high above any such influence.</p>

<p>3. Assuming you do consent to the adaptation, in a
desire to oblige Oxenford, I would not recommend your
asking any pecuniary compensation. This for two reasons:
firstly, because the compensation could only be small at the
best; secondly, because your taking it would associate you
(unreasonably, but not the less assuredly) with the opera.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The only objection I descry is purely one of feeling.
Pauline trotting about in front of the float, invoking the
orchestra with a limp pocket-handkerchief, is a notion that
makes goose-flesh of my back. Also a yelping tenor going
away to the wars in a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scena'">scene a</ins> half-an-hour long is painful to
contemplate. Damas, too, as a bass, with a grizzled bald
head, blatently bellowing about</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Baylis</span>,</div>

<p>I have just come home. Finding your note, I write
to you at once, or you might do me the wrong of supposing
me unmindful of it and you.</p>

<p>I agree with you about Smith himself, and I don't think
it necessary to pursue the painful subject. Such things are

<p>I was at your lecture<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> this afternoon, and I hope I
may venture to tell you that I was extremely pleased and
interested. Both the matter of the materials and the
manner of their arrangement were quite admirable, and a
modesty and complete absence of any kind of affectation
pervaded the whole discourse, which was quite an example
to the many whom it concerns. If you could be a very
little louder, and would never let a sentence go for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
thousandth part of an instant until the last word is out,
you would find the audience more responsive.</p>

<p>A spoken sentence will never run alone in all its life,
and is never to be trusted to itself in its most insignificant
member. See it <i>well out</i>&mdash;with the voice&mdash;and the part of
the audience is made surprisingly easier. In that excellent
description of the Spanish mendicant and his guitar, as
well as the very happy touches about the dance and the
castanets, the people were really desirous to express very
hearty appreciation; but by giving them rather too much
to do in watching and listening for latter words, you
stopped them. I take the liberty of making the remark,
as one who has fought with beasts (oratorically) in divers
arenas. For the rest nothing could be better. Knowledge,
ingenuity, neatness, condensation, good sense, and good
taste in delightful combination.</p>

<p>I came over to France before Georgina and Mary, and
went to Boulogne to meet them coming in by the steamer on
the great Sunday&mdash;the day of the storm. I stood (holding
on with both hands) on the pier at Boulogne, five hours.
The Sub-Marine Telegraph had telegraphed their boat
as having come out of Folkestone&mdash;though the companion
boat from Boulogne didn't try it&mdash;and at nine o'clock at
night, she being due at six, there were no signs of her.
My principal dread was, that she would try to get into
Boulogne; which she could not possibly have done
without carrying away everything on deck. The tide at
nine o'clock being too low for any such desperate attempt,
I thought it likely that they had run for the Downs and
would knock about there all night. So I went to the Inn to
dry my pea-jacket and get some dinner anxiously enough,
when, at about ten, came a telegram from them at Calais
to say they had run in there. To Calais I went, post,
next morning, expecting to find them half-dead (of course,
they had arrived half-drowned), but I found them elaborately
got up to come on to Paris by the next Train,
and the most wonderful thing of all was, that they hardly
seem to have been frightened! Of course, they had discovered
at the end of the voyage, that a young bride
and her husband, the only other passengers on deck,
and with whom they had been talking all the time, were
an officer from Chatham whom they knew very well (when
dry), just married and going to India! So they all set
up house-keeping together at Dessin's at Calais (where I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
am well known), and looked as if they had been passing
a mild summer there.</p>

<p>We have a pretty apartment here, but house-rent is
awful to mention. Mrs. Bouncer (muzzled by the Parisian
police) is also here, and is a wonderful spectacle to
behold in the streets, restrained like a raging Lion.</p>

<p>I learn from an embassy here, that the Emperor has
just made an earnest proposal to our Government to
unite with France (and Russia, if Russia will) in an appeal
to America to stop the brutal war. Our Government's
answer is not yet received, but I think I clearly perceive
that the proposal will be declined, on the ground "that
the time has not yet come."</p>

<p>If you are obliged, as you were last year, to go away
between Christmas Day and New Year's Day, then we rely
upon your coming back to see the old year out. Furthermore,
I rely upon you for this: Lady Molesworth says she
will come down for a day or two, and I have told her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tha'">that</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
I shall ask you to be her escort, and to arrange a time.
Will you take counsel with her, and arrange accordingly?
After our family visitors are gone, Mary is going a-hunting
in Hampshire; but if you and Lady Molesworth could make
out from Saturday, the 9th of January, as your day of
coming together, or for any day between that and Saturday,
the 16th, it would be beforehand with her going and would
suit me excellently. There is a new officer at the dockyard,
<i>vice</i> Captain &mdash;&mdash; (now an admiral), and I will take that opportunity
of paying him and his wife the attention of asking
them to dine in these gorgeous halls. For all of which
reasons, if the Social Science Congress of two could meet
and arrive at a conclusion, the conclusion would be thankfully
booked by the illustrious writer of these lines.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve there is a train from your own
Victoria Station at 4.35 p.m., which will bring you to
Strood (Rochester Bridge Station) in an hour, and there a
majestic form will be descried in a Basket.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Bulwer Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I am truly sorry to reply to your kind and welcome
note that we cannot come to Knebworth on a visit at this
time: firstly, because I am tied by the leg to my book.
Secondly, because my married daughter and her husband
are with us. Thirdly, because my two boys are at home
for their holidays.</p>

<p>But if you would come out of that murky electioneering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
atmosphere and come to us, you don't know how delighted
we should be. You should have your own way as completely
as though you were at home. You should have
a cheery room, and you should have a Swiss ch&acirc;let all to
yourself to write in. <i>Smoking regarded as a personal
favour to the family.</i> Georgina is so insupportably vain
on account of being a favourite of yours, that you might
find <i>her</i> a drawback; but nothing else would turn out
in that way, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Won't</i> you manage it? <i>Do</i> think of it. If, for instance,
you would come back with us on that Guild Saturday. I
have turned the house upside down and inside out since
you were here, and have carved new rooms out of places
then non-existent. Pray do think of it, and do manage
it. I should be heartily pleased.</p>

<p>I hope you will find the purpose and the plot of my
book very plain when you see it as a whole piece. I am
looking forward to sending you the proofs complete about
the end of next month. It is all sketched out and I am
working hard on it, giving it all the pains possible to be
bestowed on a labour of love. Your critical opinion two
months in advance of the public will be invaluable to me.
For you know what store I set by it, and how I think over
a hint from you.</p>

<p>I notice the latest piece of poisoning ingenuity in
Pritchard's case. When he had made his medical student
boarders sick, by poisoning the family food, he then quietly
walked out, took an emetic, and made himself sick. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with a view to ask them, in examination on a possible trial,
whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the
rest?&mdash;A question naturally asked for him and answered
in the affirmative. From which I get at the fact.</p>

<p>If your constituency don't bring you in they deserve to
lose you, and may the Gods continue to confound them! I
shudder at the thought of such public life as political life.
Would there not seem to be something horribly rotten
in the system of it, when one stands amazed how any
man&mdash;not forced into it by position, as you are&mdash;can bear
to live it?</p>

<p>But the private life here is my point, and again I urge

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Forster</span>,</div>

<p>I most heartily hope that your doleful apprehensions
will prove unfounded. These changes from muggy
weather to slight sharp frost, and back again, touch weak
places, as I find by my own foot; but the touch goes by.
May it prove so with you!</p>

<p>Yesterday Captain &mdash;&mdash;, Captain &mdash;&mdash;, and Captain
&mdash;&mdash;, dined at Gad's. They are, all three, naval officers
of the highest reputation. &mdash;&mdash; is supposed to be the best
sailor in our Service. I said I had been remarking at
home, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the <i>London</i>, that I knew of no shipwreck
of a large strong ship (not carrying weight of
guns) in the open sea, and that I could find none such in
the shipwreck books. They all agreed that the unfortunate
Captain Martin <i>must</i> have been unacquainted with the
truth as to what can and what can not be done with a
Steamship having rigging and canvas; and that no sailor
would dream of turning a ship's stern to such a gale&mdash;<i>unless
his vessel could run faster than the sea</i>. &mdash;&mdash; said
(and the other two confirmed) that the <i>London</i> was the
better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale, and
that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm
topsail&mdash;which is hoisted from the deck and requires no
man to be sent aloft, and can be set under the worst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
circumstances&mdash;the disaster could not have occurred.
If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it,
even of hammocks and the like. They said that under
a Board of Enquiry into the wreck, any efficient witness
must of necessity state this as the fact, and could not
possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was
utterly bad; and as to the force of the wind, for which
I suggested allowance, they all had been in West Indian
hurricanes and in Typhoons, and had put the heads of their
ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>I thought you might be interested in this, as you have
no doubt been interested in the case. They had a great
respect for the unfortunate Captain's character, and for
his behaviour when the case was hopeless, but they had
not the faintest doubt that he lost the ship and those two
hundred and odd lives.</p>

<p>You make an absurd, though common mistake, in
supposing that any human creature can help you to be
an authoress, if you cannot become one in virtue of your
own powers. I know nothing about "impenetrable
barrier," "outsiders," and "charmed circles." I know that
anyone who can write what is suitable to the requirements
of my own journal&mdash;for instance&mdash;is a person I am
heartily glad to discover, and do not very often find.
And I believe this to be no rare case in periodical literature.
I cannot undertake to advise you in the abstract,
as I number my unknown correspondents by the hundred.
But if you offer anything to me for insertion in "All the

read, and that it will be judged by no test but its own
merits and adaptability to those pages.</p>

<p>It would have been really painful to me, if I had
seen you and yours at a Reading of mine in right of any
other credentials than my own. Your appreciation has
given me higher and purer gratification than your modesty
can readily believe. When I first entered on this interpretation
of myself (then quite strange in the public ear)
I was sustained by the hope that I could drop into
some hearts, some new expression of the meaning of my
books, that would touch them in a new way. To this
hour that purpose is so strong in me, and so real are my
fictions to myself, that, after hundreds of nights, I come
with a feeling of perfect freshness to that little red table,

<p>Although I think the scheme has many good points,
I have this doubt: Would boys so maintained at any one of
our great public schools stand at a decided disadvantage
towards boys not so maintained? Foundation Scholars, in
many cases, win their way into public schools and so enforce
respect and even assert superiority. In many other cases
their patron is a remote and misty person, or Institution,
sanctioned by Time and custom. But the proposed position
would be a very different one for a student to hold, and
boys are too often inconsiderate, proud, and cruel. I should
like to know whether this point has received consideration
from the projectors of the design?</p>

<p>Your cheering letter of the 21st of August arrived
here this morning. A thousand thanks for it. I begin to
think (nautically) that I "head west'ard." You shall hear
from me fully and finally as soon as Dolby shall have
reported personally.</p>

<p>The other day I received a letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of New
York (who came over in the winning yacht, and described
the voyage in <i>The Times</i>), saying he would much like to see
me. I made an appointment in London, and observed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
when he <i>did</i> see me he was obviously astonished. While I
was sensible that the magnificence of my appearance would
fully account for his being overcome, I nevertheless angled
for the cause of his surprise. He then told me that there
was a paragraph going round the papers to the effect that I
was "in a critical state of health." I asked him if he was
sure it wasn't "cricketing" state of health. To which he
replied, Quite. I then asked him down here to dinner, and
he was again staggered by finding me in sporting training;
also much amused.</p>

<p>Yesterday's and to-day's post bring me this unaccountable
paragraph from hosts of uneasy friends, with the
enormous and wonderful addition that "eminent surgeons"
are sending me to America for "cessation from literary
labour"!!! So I have written a quiet line to <i>The Times</i>,
certifying to my own state of health, and have also begged
Dixon to do the like in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>. I mention the
matter to you, in order that you may contradict, from me,
if the nonsense should reach America unaccompanied by
the truth. But I suppose that <i>The New York Herald</i> will
probably have got the letter from Mr. &mdash;&mdash; aforesaid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Charles Reade and Wilkie Collins are here; and the
joke of the time is to feel my pulse when I appear at table,
and also to inveigle innocent messengers to come over to
the summer-house, where I write (the place is quite changed
since you were here, and a tunnel under the highroad connects
this shrubbery with the front garden), to ask, with
their compliments, how I find myself <i>now</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>If I come to America this next November, even you can
hardly imagine with what interest I shall try Copperfield on
an American audience, or, if they give me their heart, how
freely and fully I shall give them mine. We will ask Dolby
then whether he ever heard it before.</p>

<p>I cannot thank you enough for your invaluable help to
Dolby. He writes that at every turn and moment the
sense and knowledge and tact of Mr. Osgood are inestimable
to him.</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you that the play was admirably
done last night, and made a marked impression. Pauline
is weak, but so carefully trained and fitted into the picture
as to be never disagreeable, and sometimes (as in the last
scene) very pathetic. Fechter has played nothing nearly
so well as Claude since he played in Paris in the "Dame
aux Cam&eacute;lias," or in London as Ruy Blas. He played the
fourth act as finely as Macready, and the first much better.
The dress and bearing in the fifth act are quite new, and
quite excellent.</p>

<p>Of the Scenic arrangements, the most noticeable are:&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
picturesque struggle of the cottage between the taste
of an artist, and the domestic means of poverty (expressed
to the eye with infinite tact);&mdash;the view of Lyons (Act v.
Scene 1), with a foreground of quay wall which the officers
are leaning on, waiting for the general;&mdash;and the last scene&mdash;a
suite of rooms giving on a conservatory at the back,
through which the moon is shining. You are to understand
that all these scenic appliances are subdued to the
Piece, instead of the Piece being sacrificed to them; and
that every group and situation has to be considered, not
only with a reference to each by itself, but to the whole
story.</p>

<p>Beaus&eacute;ant's speaking the original contents of the
letter was a decided point, and the immense house was
quite breathless when the Tempter and the Tempted stood
confronted as he made the proposal.</p>

<p>There was obviously a great interest in seeing a
Frenchman play the part. The scene between Claude
and Gaspar (the small part very well done) was very
closely watched for the same reason, and was loudly
applauded. I cannot say too much of the brightness,
intelligence, picturesqueness, and care of Fechter's impersonation
throughout. There was a remarkable delicacy
in his gradually drooping down on his way home
with his bride, until he fell upon the table, a crushed heap
of shame and remorse, while his mother told Pauline the
story. His gradual recovery of himself as he formed
better resolutions was equally well expressed; and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
being at last upright again and rushing enthusiastically
to join the army, brought the house down.</p>

<p>I wish you could have been there. He never spoke
English half so well as he spoke your English; and the
audience heard it with the finest sympathy and respect.
I felt that I should have been very proud indeed to have
been the writer of the Play.</p>

<p>I hope the telegraph clerks did not mutilate out of
recognition or reasonable guess the words I added to
Dolby's last telegram to Boston. "<i>Tribune</i> London correspondent
totally false." Not only is there not a word
of truth in the pretended conversation, but it is so
absurdly unlike me that I cannot suppose it to be even
invented by anyone who ever heard me exchange a
word with mortal creature. For twenty years I am perfectly
certain that I have never made any other allusion
to the republication of my books in America than the
good-humoured remark, "that if there had been international
copyright between England and the States, I should
have been a man of very large fortune, instead of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
man of moderate savings, always supporting a very expensive
public position." Nor have I ever been such a
fool as to charge the absence of international copyright
upon individuals. Nor have I ever been so ungenerous
as to disguise or suppress the fact that I have received
handsome sums for advance sheets. When I was in the
States, I said what I had to say on the question, and
there an end. I am absolutely certain that I have never
since expressed myself, even with soreness, on the subject.
Reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the
London correspondent, the statement that I ever talked
about "these fellows" who republished my books or
pretended to know (what I don't know at this instant)
who made how much out of them, or ever talked of
their sending me "conscience money," is as grossly and
completely false as the statement that I ever said anything
to the effect that I could not be expected to have an
interest in the American people. And nothing can by
any possibility be falser than that. Again and again in
these pages ("All the Year Round") I have expressed
my interest in them. You will see it in the "Child's
History of England." You will see it in the last preface
to "American Notes." Every American who has ever
spoken with me in London, Paris, or where not, knows
whether I have frankly said, "You could have no better
introduction to me than your country." And for years
and years when I have been asked about reading in
America, my invariable reply has been, "I have so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
friends there, and constantly receive so many earnest
letters from personally unknown readers there, that, but
for domestic reasons, I would go to-morrow." I think
I must, in the confidential intercourse between you and
me, have written you to this effect more than once.</p>

<p>The statement of the London correspondent from
beginning to end is false. It is false in the letter and
false in the spirit. He may have been misinformed, and
the statement may not have originated with him. With
whomsoever it originated, it never originated with me,
and consequently is false. More than enough about it.</p>

<p>As I hope to see you so soon, my dear Fields, and as
I am busily at work on the Christmas number, I will
not make this a longer letter than I can help. I thank
you most heartily for your proffered hospitality, and
need not tell you that if I went to any friend's house in
America, I would go to yours. But the readings are
very hard work, and I think I cannot do better than
observe the rule on that side of the Atlantic which I
observe on this, of never, under such circumstances, going
to a friend's house, but always staying at a hotel. I am
able to observe it here, by being consistent and never
breaking it. If I am equally consistent there, I can (I
hope) offend no one.</p>

<p>Dolby sends his love to you and all his friends (as I do),
and is girding up his loins vigorously.</p>

<p>Behold the best of my judgment on your questions.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Susan Hopley and Jonathan Bradford? No. Too well
known.</p>

<p>London Strikes and Spitalfields Cutters? Yes.</p>

<p>Fighting FitzGerald? Never mind him.</p>

<p>Duel of Lord Mohun and Duke of Hamilton? Ye-e-es.</p>

<p>Irish Abductions? I think not.</p>

<p>Brunswick Theatre? More Yes than No.</p>

<p>Theatrical Farewells? Yes.</p>

<p>Bow Street Runners (as compared with Modern
Detectives)? Yes.</p>

<p>Vauxhall and Ranelagh in the Last Century? Most
decidedly. Don't forget Miss Burney.</p>

<p>Smugglers? No. Overdone.</p>

<p>Lacenaire? No. Ditto.</p>

<p>Madame Laffarge? No. Ditto.</p>

<p>Fashionable Life Last Century? Most decidedly yes.</p>

<p>Debates on the Slave Trade? Yes, generally. But
beware of the Pirates, as we did them in the beginning
of "Household Words."</p>

<p>Certainly I acquit you of all blame in the Bedford
case. But one cannot do otherwise than sympathise with
a son who is reasonably tender of his father's memory.
And no amount of private correspondence, we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
remember, reaches the readers of a printed and published
statement.</p>

<p>I told you some time ago that I believed the arsenic
in Eliza Fenning's case to have been administered by
the apprentice. I never was more convinced of anything
in my life than of the girl's innocence, and I want words
in which to express my indignation at the muddle-headed
story of that parsonic blunderer whose audacity
and conceit distorted some words that fell from her in
the last days of her baiting.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I am truly delighted to find that you are so well
pleased with Fechter in "The Lady of Lyons." It was
a labour of love with him, and I hold him in very high
regard.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> give way to laziness, and <i>do</i> proceed with that
play. There never was a time when a good new play
was more wanted, or had a better opening for itself.
Fechter is a thorough artist, and what he may sometimes
want in personal force is compensated by the admirable
whole he can make of a play, and his perfect understanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of its presentation as a picture to the eye and
mind.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">"All the Year Round" Office</span>,</span><br />
<i>Friday, 25th October, 1867.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Lytton</span>,</div>

<p>I have read the Play<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> with great attention, interest,
and admiration; and I need not say to <i>you</i> that the art of
it&mdash;the fine construction&mdash;the exquisite nicety of the touches&mdash;with
which it is wrought out&mdash;have been a study to me
in the pursuit of which I have had extraordinary relish.</p>

<p>Taking the Play as it stands, I have nothing whatever
to add to your notes and memoranda of the points to be
touched again, except that I have a little uneasiness in
that burst of anger and inflexibility consequent on having
been deceived, coming out of Hegio. I see the kind
of actor who <i>must</i> play Hegio, and I see that the audience
will not believe in his doing anything so serious. (I
suppose it would be impossible to get this effect out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the mother&mdash;or through the mother's influence, instead
of out of the godfather of Hegiopolis?)</p>

<p>Now, as to the classical ground and manners of the
Play. I suppose the objection to the Greek dress to be
already&mdash;as Defoe would write it, "gotten over" by your
suggestion. I suppose the dress not to be conventionally
associated with stilts and boredom, but to be new to the
public eye and very picturesque. Grant all that;&mdash;the
names remain. Now, not only used such names to be
inseparable in the public mind from stately weariness,
but of late days they have become inseparable in the
same public mind from silly puns upon the names, and
from Burlesque. You do not know (I hope, at least, for
my friend's sake) what the Strand Theatre is. A Greek
name and a break-down nigger dance, have become
inseparable there. I do not mean to say that your genius
may not be too powerful for such associations; but I do
most positively mean to say that you would lose half the
play in overcoming them. At the best you would have
to contend against them through the first three acts.
The old tendency to become frozen on classical ground
would be in the best part of the audience; the new tendency
to titter on such ground would be in the worst
part. And instead of starting fair with the audience, it
is my conviction that you would start with them against
you and would have to win them over.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with reference to your note to me on this
head, you take up a position with reference to poor dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Talfourd's "Ion" which I altogether dispute. It never
was a popular play, I say. It derived a certain amount
of out-of-door's popularity from the circumstances under
which, and the man by whom, it was written. But I say
that it never was a popular play on the Stage, and never
made out a case of attraction there.</p>

<p>As to changing the ground to Russia, let me ask you,
did you ever see the "Nouvelles Russes" of Nicolas Gogol,
translated into French by Louis Viardot? There is a story
among them called "Tarass Boulla," in which, as it seems
to me, all the conditions you want for such transplantation
are to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">be</ins> found. So changed, you would have the popular
sympathy with the Slave or Serf, or Prisoner of War, from
the first. But I do not think it is to be got, save at great
hazard, and with lamentable waste of force on the ground
the Play now occupies.</p>

<p>I shall keep this note until to-morrow to correct my
conviction if I can see the least reason for correcting it;
but I feel very confident indeed that I cannot be shaken
in it.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>Articles of Agreement entered into at Baltimore, in the
United States of America, this third day of February in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
between &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, British subject, <i>alias</i> the man of
Ross, and &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, American citizen, <i>alias</i> the Boston
Bantam.</p>

<p>Whereas, some Bounce having arisen between the above
men in reference to feats of pedestrianism and agility, they
have agreed to settle their differences and prove who is
the better man, by means of a walking-match for two hats
a side and the glory of their respective countries; and
whereas they agree that the said match shall come off,
whatsoever the weather, on the Mill Dam Road outside
Boston, on Saturday, the twenty-ninth day of this present
month; and whereas they agree that the personal attendants
on themselves during the whole walk, and also the umpires
and starters and declarers of victory in the match shall be
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; of Boston, known in sporting circles as Massachusetts
Jemmy, and Charles Dickens of Falstaff's Gad's
Hill, whose surprising performances (without the least
variation) on that truly national instrument, the American
catarrh, have won for him the well-merited title of the
Gad's Hill Gasper:</p>

<p>1. The men are to be started, on the day appointed, by
Massachusetts Jemmy and The Gasper.</p>

<p>2. Jemmy and The Gasper are, on some previous day,
to walk out at the rate of not less than four miles an hour
by The Gasper's watch, for one hour and a half. At the
expiration of that one hour and a half they are to carefully
note the place at which they halt. On the match's coming
off they are to station themselves in the middle of the road,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
at that precise point, and the men (keeping clear of them
and of each other) are to turn round them, right shoulder
inward, and walk back to the starting-point. The man
declared by them to pass the starting-point first is to be
the victor and the winner of the match.</p>

<p>3. No jostling or fouling allowed.</p>

<p>4. All cautions or orders issued to the men by the
umpires, starters, and declarers of victory to be considered
final and admitting of no appeal.</p>

<p>A sporting narrative of the match to be written by The
Gasper within one week after its coming off, and the same
to be duly printed (at the expense of the subscribers to
these articles) on a broadside. The said broadside to
be framed and glazed, and one copy of the same to be
carefully preserved by each of the subscribers to these
articles.</p>

<p>6. The men to show on the evening of the day of
walking at six o'clock precisely, at the Parker House,
Boston, when and where a dinner will be given them by
The Gasper. The Gasper to occupy the chair, faced by
Massachusetts Jemmy. The latter promptly and formally
to invite, as soon as may be after the date of these presents,
the following guests to honour the said dinner with their
presence; that is to say [here follow the names of a few of
his friends, whom he wished to be invited].</p>

<p>Now, lastly. In token of their accepting the trusts and
offices by these articles conferred upon them, these articles
are solemnly and formally signed by Massachusetts Jemmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

themselves.</p>

<p>Allow me to thank you most cordially for your
kind letter, and for its accompanying books. I have a
particular love for books of travel, and shall wander into
the "Wilds of America" with great interest. I have also
received your charming Sketch with great pleasure and

beautiful suggestion of nature associated with this country,

<p>Your reference to my dear friend Washington Irving
renews the vivid impressions reawakened in my mind at
Baltimore the other day. I saw his fine face for the
last time in that city. He came there from New York
to pass a day or two with me before I went westward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and they were made among the most memorable of my
life by his delightful fancy and genial humour. Some
unknown admirer of his books and mine sent to the
hotel a most enormous mint julep, wreathed with flowers.
We sat, one on either side of it, with great solemnity (it
filled a respectable-sized paper), but the solemnity was
of very short duration. It was quite an enchanted julep,
and carried us among innumerable people and places that
we both knew. The julep held out far into the night,
and my memory never saw him afterward otherwise than
as bending over it, with his straw, with an attempted
gravity (after some anecdote, involving some wonderfully
droll and delicate observation of character), and then, as
his eyes caught mine, melting into that captivating laugh
of his which was the brightest and best I have ever
heard.</p>

<i>Sunday, 26th April, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fields</span>,</div>

<p>In order that you may have the earliest intelligence
of me, I begin this note to-day in my small cabin, purposing
(if it should prove practicable) to post it at Queenstown for
the return steamer.</p>

<p>We are already past the Banks of Newfoundland,
although our course was seventy miles to the south, with
the view of avoiding ice seen by Judkins in the <i>Scotia</i> on
his passage out to New York. The <i>Russia</i> is a magnificent
ship, and has dashed along bravely. We had made more
than thirteen hundred and odd miles at noon to-day. The
wind, after being a little capricious, rather threatens at the
present time to turn against us, but our run is already eighty
miles ahead of the <i>Russia's</i> last run in this direction&mdash;a
very fast one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To all whom it may concern, report
the <i>Russia</i> in the highest terms. She rolls more easily than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the other Cunard Screws, is kept in perfect order, and is
most carefully looked after in all departments. We have
had nothing approaching to heavy weather, still one can
speak to the trim of the ship. Her captain, a gentleman;
bright, polite, good-natured, and vigilant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As to me, I am greatly better, I hope. I have got on
my right boot to-day for the first time; the "true
American" seems to be turning faithless at last; and I
made a Gad's Hill breakfast this morning, as a further
advance on having otherwise eaten and drunk all day ever
since Wednesday.</p>

<p>You will see Anthony Trollope, I daresay. What was
my amazement to see him with these eyes come aboard in
the mail tender just before we started! He had come out
in the <i>Scotia</i> just in time to dash off again in said tender
to shake hands with me, knowing me to be aboard here.
It was most heartily done. He is on a special mission of
convention with the United States post-office.</p>

<p>We have been picturing your movements, and have
duly checked off your journey home, and have talked about
you continually. But I have thought about you both,
even much, much more. You will never know how I love
you both; or what you have been to me in America, and
will always be to me everywhere; or how fervently I
thank you.</p>

<p>All the working of the ship seems to be done on my
forehead. It is scrubbed and holystoned (my head&mdash;not
the deck) at three every morning. It is scraped and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
swabbed all day. Eight pairs of heavy boots are now
clattering on it, getting the ship under sail again. Legions
of ropes'-ends are flopped upon it as I write, and I must
leave off with Dolby's love.</p>

<div class='date'><br /><br /><i>Thursday, 30th.</i></div>

<p>Soon after I left off as above we had a gale of wind
which blew all night. For a few hours on the evening
side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of
mine to the saloon, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, so heavily did the sea
break over the decks. The ship, however, made nothing
of it, and we were all right again by Monday afternoon.
Except for a few hours yesterday (when we had a very
light head-wind), the weather has been constantly favourable,
and we are now bowling away at a great rate, with a
fresh breeze filling all our sails. We expect to be at
Queenstown between midnight and three in the morning.</p>

<p>I hope, my dear Fields, you may find this legible, but
I rather doubt it, for there is motion enough on the ship
to render writing to a landsman, however accustomed
to pen and ink, rather a difficult achievement. Besides
which, I slide away gracefully from the paper, whenever
I want to be particularly expressive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

the following items: A large dish of porridge into which
he casts slices of butter and a quantity of sugar. Two cups
of tea. A steak. Irish stew. Chutnee and marmalade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

<p>I have found it so extremely difficult to write about
America (though never so briefly) without appearing to
blow trumpets on the one hand, or to be inconsistent with
my avowed determination <i>not</i> to write about it on the
other, that I have taken the simple course enclosed. The
number will be published on the 6th of June. It appears
to me to be the most modest and manly course, and to
derive some graceful significance from its title.</p>

<p>Thank my dear Mrs. Fields for me for her delightful
letter received on the 16th. I will write to her very soon,
and tell her about the dogs. I would write by this post, but
that Wills' absence (in Sussex, and getting no better there
as yet) so overwhelms me with business that I can scarcely
get through it.</p>

<p>Miss me? Ah, my dear fellow, but how do I miss
<i>you!</i> We talk about you both at Gad's Hill every day of

<p>2. A do. of unfailing medicine for cockroaches.</p>

<p>3. Mrs. Gamp, for &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The case is addressed to you at Bleecker Street, New

promised to-morrow, and should be too late for the Cunard
packet, it will in that case come by the next following
Inman steamer.</p>

<p>Everything here looks lovely, and I find it (you will be
surprised to hear) really a pretty place! I have seen "No
Thoroughfare" twice. Excellent things in it, but it drags
to my thinking. It is, however, a great success in the

Fechter is ill, and was ordered off to Brighton yesterday.

<p>As you ask me about the dogs, I begin with them.
When I came down first, I came to Gravesend, five miles
off. The two Newfoundland dogs, coming to meet me with
the usual carriage and the usual driver, and beholding me
coming in my usual dress out at the usual door, it struck
me that their recollection of my having been absent for
any unusual time was at once cancelled. They behaved
(they are both young dogs) exactly in their usual manner;
coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along,
and lifting their heads to have their ears pulled&mdash;a special
attention which they receive from no one else. But when
I drove into the stable-yard, Linda (the St. Bernard) was
greatly excited; weeping profusely, and throwing herself
on her back that she might caress my foot with her great
fore-paws. Mamie's little dog, too, Mrs. Bouncer, barked
in the greatest agitation on being called down and asked
by Mamie, "Who is this?" and tore round and round me,
like the dog in the Faust outlines. You must know that
all the farmers turned out on the road in their market-chaises
to say, "Welcome home, sir!" and that all the
houses along the road were dressed with flags; and that
our servants, to cut out the rest, had dressed this house so
that every brick of it was hidden. They had asked Mamie's
permission to "ring the alarm-bell" (!) when master drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
up, but Mamie, having some slight idea that that compliment
might awaken master's sense of the ludicrous, had
recommended bell abstinence. But on Sunday the village
choir (which includes the bell-ringers) made amends.
After some unusually brief pious reflections in the crowns
of their hats at the end of the sermon, the ringers bolted
out, and rang like mad until I got home. There had been a
conspiracy among the villagers to take the horse out, if I
had come to our own station, and draw me here. Mamie
and Georgy had got wind of it and warned me.</p>

<p>Divers birds sing here all day, and the nightingales
all night. The place is lovely, and in perfect order. I
have put five mirrors in the Swiss ch&acirc;let (where I write)
and they reflect and refract in all kinds of ways the leaves
that are quivering at the windows, and the great fields
of waving corn, and the sail-dotted river. My room is
up among the branches of the trees; and the birds and
the butterflies fly in and out, and the green branches
shoot in, at the open windows, and the lights and
shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of
the company. The scent of the flowers, and indeed of
everything that is growing for miles and miles, is most
delicious.</p>

<p>Dolby (who sends a world of messages) found his wife
much better than he expected, and the children (wonderful
to relate!) perfect. The little girl winds up her prayers
every night with a special commendation to Heaven of me
and the pony&mdash;as if I must mount him to get there! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
dine with Dolby (I was going to write "him," but found
it would look as if I were going to dine with the pony) at
Greenwich this very day, and if your ears do not burn
from six to nine this evening, then the Atlantic is a non-conductor.
We are already settling&mdash;think of this!&mdash;the
details of my farewell course of readings. I am brown
beyond belief, and cause the greatest disappointment in all
quarters by looking so well. It is really wonderful what
those fine days at sea did for me! My doctor was quite
broken down in spirits when he saw me, for the first time
since my return, last Saturday. "Good Lord!" he said,
recoiling, "seven years younger!"</p>

<p>It is time I should explain the otherwise inexplicable
enclosure. Will you tell Fields, with my love (I suppose
he hasn't used <i>all</i> the pens yet?), that I think there is in
Tremont Street a set of my books, sent out by Chapman,
not arrived when I departed. Such set of the immortal
works of our illustrious, etc., is designed for the gentleman
to whom the enclosure is addressed. If T., F. and Co., will
kindly forward the set (carriage paid) with the enclosure to
&mdash;&mdash;'s address, I will invoke new blessings on their heads,
and will get Dolby's little daughter to mention them
nightly.</p>

<p>"No Thoroughfare" is very shortly coming out in
Paris, where it is now in active rehearsal. It is still
playing here, but without Fechter, who has been very
ill. The doctor's dismissal of him to Paris, however, and
his getting better there, enables him to get up the play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
there. He and Wilkie missed so many pieces of stage-effect
here, that, unless I am quite satisfied with his
report, I shall go over and try my stage-managerial
hand at the Vaudeville Theatre. I particularly want the
drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene
at the Swiss inn to be done to the sound of a waterfall
rising and falling with the wind. Although in the very
opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall and
listen to it, nobody thought of its mysterious music. I
could make it, with a good stage-carpenter, in an hour.</p>

<p>My dear love to Fields once again. Same to you
and him from Mamie and Georgy. I cannot tell you
both how I miss you, or how overjoyed I should be to
see you here.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Fields</span>,</div>

<p>I have delayed writing to you (and Mrs. Fields, to
whom my love) until I should have seen Longfellow. When
he was in London the first time he came and went without
reporting himself, and left me in a state of unspeakable
discomfiture. Indeed, I should not have believed in
his having been here at all, if Mrs. Procter had not told
me of his calling to see Procter. However, on his return
he wrote to me from the Langham Hotel, and I went up
to town to see him, and to make an appointment for his
coming here. He, the girls, and Appleton, came down last
Saturday night and stayed until Monday forenoon. I
showed them all the neighbouring country that could
be shown in so short a time, and they finished off with
a tour of inspection of the kitchens, pantry, wine-cellar,
pickles, sauces, servants' sitting-room, general
household stores, and even the Cellar Book, of this
illustrious establishment. Forster and Kent (the latter
wrote certain verses to Longfellow, which have been
published in <i>The Times</i>, and which I sent to D&mdash;&mdash;)
came down for a day, and I hope we all had a really
"good time." I turned out a couple of postillions in the
old red jacket of the old red royal Dover Road, for our
ride; and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty years
ago. Of course we went to look at the old houses in
Rochester, and the old cathedral, and the old castle, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the house for the six poor travellers who, "not being
rogues or procters, shall have lodging, entertainment,
and four pence each."</p>

<p>Nothing can surpass the respect paid to Longfellow
here, from the Queen downward. He is everywhere
received and courted, and finds (as I told him he would,
when we talked of it in Boston) the working-men at
least as well acquainted with his books as the classes
socially above them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I attended, as sponsor, the christening
of Dolby's son and heir&mdash;a most jolly baby, who held
on tight by the rector's left whisker while the service
was performed. What time, too, his little sister, connecting
me with the pony, trotted up and down the centre
aisle, noisily driving herself as that celebrated animal, so
that it went very hard with the sponsorial dignity.</p>

<p>Wills is not yet recovered from that concussion of the
brain, and I have all his work to do. This may account
for my not being able to devise a Christmas number, but
I seem to have left my invention in America. In case you
should find it, please send it over. I am going up to town
to-day to dine with Longfellow. And now, my dear Fields,
you know all about me and mine.</p>

<p>You are enjoying your holiday? and are still thinking
sometimes of our Boston days, as I do? and are
maturing schemes for coming here next summer? A
satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly
entreated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>I am delighted to find you both so well pleased with
the Blind Book scheme.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> I said nothing of it to you
when we were together, though I had made up my mind,
because I wanted to come upon you with that little burst
from a distance. It seemed something like meeting again
when I remitted the money and thought of your talking
of it.</p>

<p>The dryness of the weather is amazing. All the ponds
and surface-wells about here are waterless, and the poor
people suffer greatly. The people of this village have
only one spring to resort to, and it is a couple of miles
from many cottages. I do not let the great dogs swim
in the canal, because the people have to drink of it.
But when they get into the Medway it is hard to get
them out again. The other day Bumble (the son, Newfoundland
dog) got into difficulties among some floating
timber, and became frightened. Don (the father) was
standing by me, shaking off the wet and looking on
carelessly, when all of a sudden he perceived something
amiss, and went in with a bound and brought Bumble
out by the ear. The scientific way in which he towed
him along was charming.</p>

<p>I do not believe there is the slightest chance of
an international Copyright law being passed in America
for a long time to come. Some Massachusetts men do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
believe in such a thing, but they fail (as I think) to take
into account the prompt western opposition.</p>

<p>Such an alteration as you suggest in the English law
would give no copyright in America, you see. The
American publisher could buy no absolute <i>right</i> of
priority. Any American newspaper could (and many
would, in a popular case) pirate from him, as soon as they
could get the matter set up. He could buy no more
than he buys now when he arranges for advance sheets
from England, so that there may be simultaneous publication
in the two countries. And success in England is
of so much importance towards the achievement of success
in America, that I greatly doubt whether previous publications
in America would often be worth more to an
American publisher or manager than simultaneous publication.
Concerning the literary man in Parliament who
would undertake to bring in a Bill for such an amendment
of our copyright law, with weight enough to keep
his heart unbroken while he should be getting it through
its various lingering miseries, all I can say is&mdash;I decidedly
don't know him.</p>

<p>On that horrible Staplehurst day, I had not the
slightest idea that I knew anyone in the train out of
my own compartment. Mrs. Cowden Clarke<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> wrote me
afterwards, telling me in the main what you tell me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and I was astonished. It is remarkable that my watch
(a special chronometer) has never gone quite correctly
since, and to this day there sometimes comes over me,
on a railway&mdash;in a hansom cab&mdash;or any sort of conveyance&mdash;for
a few seconds, a vague sense of dread that
I have no power to check. It comes and passes, but I
cannot prevent its coming.</p>

<p>I should have written to you much sooner, but that
I have been home from the United States barely three
months, and have since been a little uncertain as to the
precise time and way of sending my youngest son out
to join his brother Alfred.</p>

<p>It is now settled that he shall come out in the ship
<i>Sussex</i>, 1000 tons, belonging to Messrs. Money, Wigram,
and Co. She sails from Gravesend, but he will join her
at Plymouth on the 27th September, and will proceed
straight to Melbourne. Of this I apprise Alfred by this
mail.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I cannot sufficiently thank you for your kindness
to Alfred. I am certain that a becoming sense of
it and desire to deserve it, has done him great good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Your report of him is an unspeakable comfort to me,
and I most heartily assure you of my gratitude and
friendship.</p>

<p>In the midst of your colonial seethings and heavings,
I suppose you have some leisure to consult equally the
hopeful prophets and the dismal prophets who are all
wiser than any of the rest of us as to things at home
here. My own strong impression is that whatsoever
change the new Reform Bill may effect will be very
gradual indeed and quite wholesome.</p>

<p>Numbers of the middle class who seldom or never
voted before will vote now, and the greater part of the
new voters will in the main be wiser as to their electoral
responsibilities and more seriously desirous to discharge
them for the common good than the bumptious singers
of "Rule Britannia," "Our dear old Church of England,"
and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>If I can ever do anything for any accredited friend

be truly glad of any opportunity of testifying that I
do not use a mere form of words in signing myself,</p>

<span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>, <i>Wednesday, December 16, 1868.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mrs. Fields</span>,</div>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. First, as you are curious about the Oliver
murder, I will tell you about that trial of the same
at which you <i>ought</i> to have assisted. There were about
a hundred people present in all. I have changed my
stage. Besides that back screen which you know so well,
there are two large screens of the same colour, set off, one
on either side, like the "wings" at a theatre. And besides
these again, we have a quantity of curtains of the same
colour, with which to close in any width of room from
wall to wall. Consequently, the figure is now completely
isolated, and the slightest action becomes much more
important. This was used for the first time on the occasion.
But behind the stage&mdash;the orchestra being very large and
built for the accommodation of a numerous chorus&mdash;there
was ready, on the level of the platform, a very long table,
beautifully lighted, with a large staff of men ready to open
oysters and set champagne-corks flying. Directly I had
done, the screens being whisked off by my people, there
was disclosed one of the prettiest banquets you can
imagine; and when all the people came up, and the gay
dresses of the ladies were lighted by those powerful lights
of mine, the scene was exquisitely pretty; the hall being
newly decorated, and very elegantly; and the whole looking
like a great bed of flowers and diamonds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, you must know that all this company were, before
the wine went round, unmistakably pale, and had horror-stricken
faces. Next morning Harness (Fields knows&mdash;Rev.
William&mdash;did an edition of Shakespeare&mdash;old friend
of the Kembles and Mrs. Siddons), writing to me about it,
and saying it was "a most amazing and terrific thing,"
added, "but I am bound to tell you that I had an almost
irresistible impulse upon me to <i>scream</i>, and that, if anyone
had cried out, I am certain I should have followed." He
had no idea that, on the night, P&mdash;&mdash;, the great ladies'
doctor, had taken me aside and said: "My dear Dickens,
you may rely upon it that if only one woman cries out
when you murder the girl, there will be a contagion of
hysteria all over this place." It is impossible to soften it
without spoiling it, and you may suppose that I am rather
anxious to discover how it goes on the 5th of January!!!
We are afraid to announce it elsewhere, without knowing,
except that I have thought it pretty safe to put it up once
in Dublin. I asked Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash;, the famous actress, who was
at the experiment: "What do <i>you</i> say? Do it or not?"
"Why, of course, do it," she replied. "Having got at
such an effect as that, it must be done. But," rolling her
large black eyes very slowly, and speaking very distinctly,
"the public have been looking out for a sensation these
last fifty years or so, and by Heaven they have got it!"
With which words, and a long breath and a long stare,
she became speechless. Again, you may suppose that I am
a little anxious!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a day passes but Dolby and I talk about you both,
and recall where we were at the corresponding time of last
year. My old likening of Boston to Edinburgh has been
constantly revived within these last ten days. There is a
certain remarkable similarity of <i>tone</i> between the two
places. The audiences are curiously alike, except that the
Edinburgh audience has a quicker sense of humour and is
a little more genial. No disparagement to Boston in this,
because I consider an Edinburgh audience perfect.</p>

<p>I trust, my dear Eugenius, that you have recognised
yourself in a certain Uncommercial, and also some small
reference to a name rather dear to you? As an instance of
how strangely something comic springs up in the midst of
the direst misery, look to a succeeding Uncommercial, called
"A Small Star in the East," published to-day, by-the-bye.
I have described, <i>with exactness</i>, the poor places into which
I went, and how the people behaved, and what they said.
I was wretched, looking on; and yet the boiler-maker and
the poor man with the legs filled me with a sense of drollery
not to be kept down by any pressure.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of this place, compounded of mists from
the highlands and smoke from the town factories, is crushing
my eyebrows as I write, and it rains as it never does
rain anywhere else, and always does rain here. It is a
dreadful place, though much improved and possessing a
deal of public spirit. Improvement is beginning to knock
the old town of Edinburgh about, here and there; but the
Canongate and the most picturesque of the horrible courts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and wynds are not to be easily spoiled, or made fit for the
poor wretches who people them to live in. Edinburgh is
so changed as to its notabilities, that I had the only three
men left of the Wilson and Jeffrey time to dine with me
there, last Saturday.</p>

<p>I think you will find "Fatal Zero" (by Percy Fitzgerald)
a very curious analysis of a mind, as the story advances.
A new beginner in "A. Y. R." (Hon. Mrs. Clifford, Kinglake's
sister), who wrote a story in the series just finished, called
"The Abbot's Pool," has just sent me another story. I
have a strong impression that, with care, she will step into
Mrs. Gaskell's vacant place. Wills is no better, and I
have work enough even in that direction.</p>

<p>God bless the woman with the black mittens for making
me laugh so this morning! I take her to be a kind of
public-spirited Mrs. Sparsit, and as such take her to my
bosom. God bless you both, my dear friends, in this
Christmas and New Year time, and in all times, seasons,
and places, and send you to Gad's Hill with the next
flowers!</p>

<p>I have received your kind note this morning, and
I hasten to thank you for it, and to assure your dear
mother of our most cordial sympathy with her in her
great affliction, and in loving remembrance of the good
man and excellent friend we have lost. The tidings of
his being very ill indeed had, of course, been reported
to me. For some days past I had taken up the newspaper
with sad misgivings; and this morning, before I
got your letter, they were realised.</p>

<p>I loved him truly. His wonderful gentleness and
kindness, years ago, when we had sickness in our household
in Paris, has never been out of my grateful remembrance.
And, socially, his image is inseparable from some
of the most genial and delightful friendly hours of my life.
I am almost ashamed to set such recollections by the side
of your mother's great bereavement and grief, but they
spring out of the fulness of my heart.</p>

<p>May God be with her and with you all!</p>

Ever yours affectionately.<br />

<p>The faithful <i>Russia</i> will bring this out to you, as a
sort of warrant to take you into loving custody and bring
you back on her return trip.</p>

<p>I rather think that when the 12th of June shall have
shaken off these shackles,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> there <i>will</i> be borage on the lawn
at Gad's. Your heart's desire in that matter, and in the
minor particulars of Cobham Park, Rochester Castle, and
Canterbury, shall be fulfilled, please God! The red jackets
shall turn out again upon the turnpike-road, and picnics
among the cherry-orchards and hop-gardens shall be heard
of in Kent. Then, too, shall the Uncommercial resuscitate
(being at present nightly murdered by Mr. W. Sikes) and
uplift his voice again.</p>

<p>The chief officer of the <i>Russia</i> (a capital fellow) was at
the Reading last night, and Dolby specially charged him
with the care of you and yours. We shall be on the
borders of Wales, and probably about Hereford, when
you arrive. Dolby has insane projects of getting over
here to meet you; so amiably hopeful and obviously
impracticable, that I encourage him to the utmost.
The regular little captain of the <i>Russia</i>, Cook, is just
now changed into the <i>Cuba</i>, whence arise disputes of
seniority, etc. I wish he had been with you, for I liked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
him very much when I was his passenger. I like to
think of your being in <i>my</i> ship!</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; have been taking it by turns to be "on
the point of death," and have been complimenting one
another greatly on the fineness of the point attained. My
people got a very good impression of &mdash;&mdash;, and thought
her a sincere and earnest little woman.</p>

<p>The <i>Russia</i> hauls out into the stream to-day, and I
fear her people may be too busy to come to us to-night.
But if any of them do, they shall have the warmest of
welcomes for your sake. (By-the-bye, a very good party
of seamen from the Queen's ship <i>Donegal</i>, lying in the
Mersey, have been told off to decorate St. George's Hall
with the ship's bunting. They were all hanging on aloft
upside down, holding to the gigantically high roof by
nothing, this morning, in the most wonderfully cheerful
manner.)</p>

<p>My son Charley has come for the dinner, and Chappell
(my Proprietor, as&mdash;isn't it Wemmick?&mdash;says) is coming
to-day, and Lord Dufferin (Mrs. Norton's nephew) is to
come and make <i>the</i> speech. I don't envy the feelings of
my noble friend when he sees the hall. Seriously, it is
less adapted to speaking than Westminster Abbey, and
is as large.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I hope you will see Fechter in a really clever piece by
Wilkie.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Also you will see the Academy Exhibition, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
will be a very good one; and also we will, please God, see
everything and more, and everything else after that. I
begin to doubt and fear on the subject of your having a
horror of me after seeing the murder. I don't think a
hand moved while I was doing it last night, or an eye
looked away. And there was a fixed expression of horror
of me, all over the theatre, which could not have been
surpassed if I had been going to be hanged to that red
velvet table. It is quite a new sensation to be execrated
with that unanimity; and I hope it will remain so!</p>

<p>[Is it lawful&mdash;would that woman in the black gaiters,
green veil, and spectacles, hold it so&mdash;to send my love to
the pretty M&mdash;&mdash;?]</p>

<p>Pack up, my dear Fields, and be quick.</p>

<p>I am finishing my Farewell Readings&mdash;to-night is the
seventy-fourth out of one hundred&mdash;and have barely time to
send you a line to thank you most heartily for yours of the
30th January, and for your great kindness to Alfred and
Edward. The latter wrote by the same mail, on behalf of
both, expressing the warmest gratitude to you, and reporting
himself in the stoutest heart and hope. I never can thank
you sufficiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>You will see that the new Ministry has made a decided
hit with its Budget, and that in the matter of the Irish
Church it has the country at its back. You will also see
that the "Reform League" has dissolved itself, indisputably
because it became aware that the people did not want it.</p>

<p>I think the general feeling in England is a desire to get
the Irish Church out of the way of many social reforms,
and to have it done <i>with</i> as already done <i>for</i>. I do not in
the least believe myself that agrarian Ireland is to be
pacified by any such means, or can have it got out of its
mistaken head that the land is of right the peasantry's,
and that every man who owns land has stolen it and is
therefore to be shot. But that is not the question.</p>

<p>The clock strikes post-time as I write, and I fear to
write more, lest, at this distance from London, I should
imperil the next mail.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Chappell</span>,</div>

<p>I am really touched by your letter. I can most
truthfully assure you that your part in the inconvenience of
this mishap has given me much more concern than my
own; and that if I did not hope to have our London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Farewells yet, I should be in a very gloomy condition on
your account.</p>

<p>Pray do not suppose that <i>you</i> are to blame for my
having done a little too much&mdash;a wild fancy indeed! The
simple fact is, that the rapid railway travelling was stretched
a hair's breadth too far, and that <i>I</i> ought to have foreseen it.
For, on the night before the last night of our reading in
America, when Dolby was cheering me with a review of the
success, and the immediate prospect of the voyage home, I
told him, to his astonishment: "I am too far gone, and
too worn out to realise anything but my own exhaustion.
Believe me, if I had to read but twice more, instead of
once, I couldn't do it." We were then just beyond our
recent number. And it was the travelling that I had felt
throughout.</p>

<p>The sharp precautionary remedy of stopping instantly,
was almost as instantly successful the other day. I told
Dr. Watson that he had never seen me knocked out of
time, and that he had no idea of the rapidity with which I
should come up again.</p>

<p>Just as three days' repose on the Atlantic steamer made
me, in my altered appearance, the amazement of the
captain, so this last week has set me up, thank God, in the
most wonderful manner. The sense of exhaustion seems a
dream already. Of course I shall train myself carefully,
nevertheless, all through the summer and autumn.</p>

<p>I beg to send my kind regards to Mrs. Chappell, and I
shall hope to see her and you at Teddington in the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
bright days. It would disappoint me indeed if a lasting
friendship did not come of our business relations.</p>

<p>In the spring I trust I shall be able to report to you
that I am ready to take my Farewells in London. Of this
I am pretty certain: that I never will take them at all,
unless with you on your own conditions.</p>

<p>With an affectionate regard for you and your brother,
believe me always,</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Rusden</span>,</div>

<p>As I daresay some exaggerated accounts of my
having been very ill have reached you, I begin with the
true version of the case.</p>

<p>I daresay I <i>should</i> have been very ill if I had not
suddenly stopped my Farewell Readings when there were
yet five-and-twenty remaining to be given. I was quite
exhausted, and was warned by the doctors to stop (for the
time) instantly. Acting on the advice, and going home
into Kent for rest, I immediately began to recover, and
within a fortnight was in the brilliant condition in which I
can now&mdash;thank God&mdash;report myself.</p>

<p>I cannot thank you enough for your care of Plorn. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
was quite prepared for his not settling down without a
lurch or two. I still hope that he may take to colonial life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In his letter to me about his leaving the station to
which he got through your kindness, he expresses his
gratitude to you quite as strongly as if he had made a
wonderful success, and seems to have acquired no distaste
for anything but the one individual of whom he wrote that
betrayed letter. But knowing the boy, I want to try him
fully.</p>

<p>You know all our public news, such as it is, at least as
well as I do. Many people here (of whom I am one) do
not like the look of American matters.</p>

<p>What I most fear is that the perpetual bluster of a
party in the States will at last set the patient British back
up. And if our people begin to bluster too, and there
should come into existence an exasperating war-party on
both sides, there will be great danger of a daily-widening
breach.</p>

<p>The first shriek of the first engine that traverses the
San Francisco Railroad from end to end will be a death-warning
to the disciples of Jo Smith. The moment the
Mormon bubble gets touched by neighbours it will break.
Similarly, the red man's course is very nearly run. A
scalped stoker is the outward and visible sign of his utter
extermination. Not Quakers enough to reach from here to
Jerusalem will save him by the term of a single year.</p>

<p>I don't know how it may be with you, but it is the
fashion here to be absolutely certain that the Emperor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the French is fastened by Providence and the fates on a
throne of adamant expressly constructed for him since the
foundations of the universe were laid.</p>

<p>He knows better, and so do the police of Paris, and
both powers must be grimly entertained by the resolute
British belief, knowing what they have known, and doing
what they have done through the last ten years. What
Victor Hugo calls "the drop-curtain, behind which is constructing
the great last act of the French Revolution,"
has been a little shaken at the bottom lately, however.
One seems to see the feet of a rather large chorus getting
ready.</p>

<p>I enclose a letter for Plorn to your care, not knowing
how to address him. Forgive me for so doing (I write to
Alfred direct), and believe me, my dear Mr. Rusden,</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Dear Miss Jolly</span>,</div>

<p>Mr. Wills has retired from here (for rest and to
recover his health), and my son, who occupies his place,
brought me this morning a story<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in MS., with a request<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that I would read it. I read it with extraordinary interest,
and was greatly surprised by its uncommon merit. On
asking whence it came, I found that it came from you!</p>

<p>You need not to be told, after this, that I accept it with
more than readiness. If you will allow me I will go over
it with great care, and very slightly touch it here and there.
I think it will require to be divided into three portions.
You shall have the proofs and I will publish it immediately.
I think so <span class="smcap">very</span> highly of it that I will have special attention
called to it in a separate advertisement. I congratulate you
most sincerely and heartily on having done a very special
thing. It will always stand apart in my mind from any

<p>"John Acland" is most willingly accepted, and shall
come in to the next monthly part. I shall make bold to
condense him here and there (according to my best idea of
story-telling), and particularly where he makes the speech:&mdash;And
with the usual fault of being too long, here and there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
I think you let the story out too much&mdash;prematurely&mdash;and
this I hope to prevent artfully. I think your title open to
the same objection, and therefore propose to substitute:</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">The Disappearance</span><br />

<p>This will leave the reader in doubt whether he really <i>was</i>

<p>I am assured by a correspondent that "John Acland"
has been done before. Said correspondent has evidently
read the story&mdash;and is almost confident in "Chambers's
Journal." This is very unfortunate, but of course cannot
be helped. There is always a possibility of such a
malignant conjunction of stars when the story is a
true one.</p>

<p>In the case of a good story&mdash;as this is&mdash;liable for
years to be told at table&mdash;as this was&mdash;there is nothing
wonderful in such a mischance. Let us shuffle the cards,
as Sancho says, and begin again.</p>

<p>You will of course understand that I do not tell
you this by way of complaint. Indeed, I should not
have mentioned it at all, but as an explanation to you
of my reason for winding the story up (which I have
done to-day) as expeditiously as possible. You might
otherwise have thought me, on reading it as published,
a little hard on Mr. Doilly. I have not had time to
direct search to be made in "Chambers's;" but as to the
main part of the story having been printed somewhere,
I have not the faintest doubt. And I believe my correspondent
to be also right as to the where. You could not
help it any more than I could, and therefore will not be
troubled by it any more than I am.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Rusden</span>,</div>

<p>This very day a great meeting is announced to come
off in London, as a demonstration in favour of a Fenian
"amnesty." No doubt its numbers and importance are
ridiculously over-estimated, but I believe the gathering will
turn out to be big enough to be a very serious obstruction
in the London streets. I have a great doubt whether
such demonstrations ought to be allowed. They are bad
as a precedent, and they unquestionably interfere with
the general liberty and freedom of the subject.</p>

<p>Moreover, the time must come when this kind of
threat and defiance will have to be forcibly stopped,
and when the unreasonable toleration of it will lead to
a sacrifice of life among the comparatively innocent
lookers-on that might have been avoided but for a false
confidence on their part, engendered in the damnable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
system of <i>laisser-aller</i>. You see how right we were, you
and I, in our last correspondence on this head, and how
desperately unsatisfactory the condition of Ireland is,
especially when considered with a reference to America.
The Government has, through Mr. Gladstone, just now
spoken out boldly in reference to the desired amnesty.
(So much the better for them or they would unquestionably
have gone by the board.) Still there is an uneasy
feeling abroad that Mr. Gladstone himself would grant this
amnesty if he dared, and that there is a great weakness
in the rest of their Irish policy. And this feeling is very
strong amongst the noisiest Irish howlers. Meanwhile,
the newspapers go on arguing Irish matters as if the Irish
were a reasonable people, in which immense assumption
I, for one, have not the smallest faith.</p>

<p>Again, I have to thank you most heartily for your
kindness to my two boys. It is impossible to predict how
Plorn will settle down, or come out of the effort to do so.
But he has unquestionably an affectionate nature, and a
certain romantic touch in him. Both of these qualities
are, I hope, more impressible for good than for evil, and
I trust in God for the rest.</p>

<p>The news of Lord Derby's death will reach you, I
suppose, at about the same time as this letter. A rash,
impetuous, passionate man; but a great loss for his party,
as a man of mind and mark. I was staying last June
with Lord Russell&mdash;six or seven years older, but (except for
being rather deaf) in wonderful preservation, and brighter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and more completely armed at all points than I have seen
him these twenty years.</p>

<p>As this need not be posted till Friday, I shall leave it
open for a final word or two; and am until then, and then,
and always afterwards, my dear Mr. Rusden,</p>

<p>We have no news in England except two slight changes
in the Government consequent on Layard's becoming our
Minister at Madrid. He is not long married to a charming
lady, and will be far better in Spain than in the House of
Commons. The Ministry are now holding councils on the
Irish Land Tenure question, which is the next difficulty
they have to deal with, as you know. Last Sunday's meeting
was a preposterous failure; still, it brought together
in the streets of London all the ruffian part of the population
of London, and that is a serious evil which any one of
a thousand accidents might render mischievous. There is
no existing law, however, to stop these assemblages, so
that they keep moving while in the streets.</p>

<p>The Government was undoubtedly wrong when it considered
it had the right to close Hyde Park; that is now
universally conceded.</p>

<p>I write to Alfred and Plorn both by this mail. They

<p>We live here (opposite the Marble Arch) in a
charming house until the 1st of June, and then return to
Gad's. The conservatory is completed, and is a brilliant
success; but an expensive one!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<p>I should be quite ashamed of not having written to you
and my dear Mrs. Fields before now, if I didn't know that
you will both understand how occupied I am, and how
naturally, when I put my papers away for the day, I get
up and fly. I have a large room here, with three fine
windows, overlooking the Park&mdash;unsurpassable for airiness
and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>You saw the announcement of the death of poor dear
Harness. The circumstances are curious. He wrote to his
old friend the Dean of Battle saying he would come to
visit him on that day (the day of his death). The Dean
wrote back: "Come next day, instead, as we are obliged
to go out to dinner, and you will be alone." Harness told
his sister a little impatiently that he <i>must</i> go on the first-named
day; that he had made up his mind to go, and
<span class="smcap">must</span>. He had been getting himself ready for dinner, and
came to a part of the staircase whence two doors opened&mdash;one,
upon another level passage; one, upon a flight of
stone steps. He opened the wrong door, fell down the
steps, injured himself very severely, and died in a few
hours.</p>

<p>You will know&mdash;<i>I</i> don't&mdash;what Fechter's success is in
America at the time of this present writing. In his farewell
performances at the Princess's he acted very finely.
I thought the three first acts of his Hamlet very much
better than I had ever thought them before&mdash;and I always
thought very highly of them. We gave him a foaming
stirrup cup at Gad's Hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Forster (who has been ill with his bronchitis again)
thinks No. 2 of the new book ("Edwin Drood") a
clincher,&mdash;I mean that word (as his own expression) for
<i>Clincher</i>. There is a curious interest steadily working up
to No. 5, which requires a great deal of art and self-denial.
I think also, apart from character and picturesqueness, that
the young people are placed in a very novel situation. So
I hope&mdash;at Nos. 5 and 6, the story will turn upon an
interest suspended until the end.</p>

<p>I can't believe it, and don't, and won't, but they say
Harry's twenty-first birthday is next Sunday. I have
entered him at the Temple just now; and if he don't get
a fellowship at Trinity Hall when his time comes, I shall
be disappointed, if in the present disappointed state of
existence.</p>

<p>I hope you may have met with the little touch of
Radicalism I gave them at Birmingham in the words of
Buckle? With pride I observe that it makes the regular
political traders, of all sorts, perfectly mad. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sich'">Such</ins> was
my intentions, as a grateful acknowledgment of having
been misrepresented.</p>

<p>I think Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s prose very admirable; but I don't
believe it! No, I do <i>not</i>. My conviction is that those
islanders get frightfully bored by the islands, and wish
they had never set eyes upon them!</p>

<p>Charley Collins has done a charming cover for the
monthly part of the new book. At the very earnest
representations of Millais (and after having seen a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
number of his drawings) I am going to engage with a
new man; retaining of course, C. C.'s cover aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Katie has made some more capital portraits, and is always
improving.</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Fields, if "He" (made proud by chairs
and bloated by pictures) does not give you my dear love,
let us conspire against him when you find him out, and
exclude him from all future confidences. Until then,</p>

<p>I ought to have mentioned in my hurried note to
you, that my knowledge of the consultation<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in question
only preceded yours by certain hours; and that Longman
asked me if I would make the design known to you, as
he thought it might be a liberty to address you otherwise.
This I did therefore.</p>

<p>The class of writers to whom you refer at the close
of your note, have no copyright, and do not come within
my case at all. I quite agree with you as to their
propensities and deserts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p><p>Indeed, I suppose in the main that there is very little

<p>Mr. Fildes has been with me this morning, and
without complaining of &mdash;&mdash; or expressing himself otherwise
than as being obliged to him for his care in No. 1,
represents that there is a brother-student of his, a wood-engraver,

<p>I have replied to him that there can be no doubt
that he has a claim beyond dispute to our employing

Therefore, we must make the change; the rather because
the fellow-student in question has engraved Mr. Fildes'
most successful drawings hitherto.</p>

<p>I send a duplicate of this note to the Haymarket,
in case it should miss you out of town. For a few years
I have been liable, at wholly uncertain and incalculable
times, to a severe attack of neuralgia in the foot, about
once in the course of a year. It began in an injury to
the finer muscles or nerves, occasioned by over-walking
in the deep snow. When it comes on I cannot stand,
and can bear no covering whatever on the sensitive place.
One of these seizures is upon me now. Until it leaves
me I could no more walk into St. James's Hall than I
could fly in the air. I hope you will present my duty
to the Prince of Wales, and assure his Royal Highness
that nothing short of my being (most unfortunately) disabled
for the moment would have prevented my attending,
as trustee of the Fund,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> at the dinner, and warmly

Rusden.</div>

<div class='date'><br /><br />
<span class="smcap">Athen&aelig;um</span>, <i>Friday Evening, 20th May, 1870.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Rusden</span>,</div>

<p>I received your most interesting and clear-sighted
letter about Plorn just before the departure of the last
mail from here to you. I did not answer then because
another incoming mail was nearly due, and I expected
(knowing Plorn so well) that some communication from
him such as he made to you would come to me. I was
not mistaken. The same arguing of the squatter question&mdash;vegetables
and all&mdash;appeared. This gave me an opportunity
of touching on those points by this mail, without
in the least compromising you. I cannot too completely
express my concurrence with your excellent idea that
his correspondence with you should be regarded as confidential.
Just as I could not possibly suggest a word
more neatly to the point, or more thoughtfully addressed,
to such a young man than your reply to his letter, I
hope you will excuse my saying that it is a perfect
model of tact, good sense, and good feeling. I had been
struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of
his holding any other position in Australasia than his
present position, and had inferred from it a homeward
tendency. What is most curious to me is that he is
very sensible, and yet does not seem to understand that
he has qualified himself for no public examinations in
the old country, and could not possibly hold his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
against any competition for anything to which I could
get him nominated.</p>

<p>But I must not trouble you about my boys as if
they were yours. It is enough that I can never thank
you for your goodness to them in a generous consideration
of me.</p>

<p>I believe the truth as to France to be that a citizen
Frenchman never forgives, and that Napoleon will never
live down the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. This makes it enormously
difficult for any well-advised English newspaper to support
him, and pretend not to know on what a volcano
his throne is set. Informed as to his designs on the
one hand, and the perpetual uneasiness of his police on
the other (to say nothing of a doubtful army), <i>The Times</i>
has a difficult game to play. My own impression is that
if it were played too boldly for him, the old deplorable
national antagonism would revive in his going down.
That the wind will pass over his Imperiality on the sands
of France I have not the slightest doubt. In no country
on the earth, but least of all there, can you seize people
in their houses on political warrants, and kill in the streets,
on no warrant at all, without raising a gigantic Nemesis&mdash;not
very reasonable in detail, perhaps, but none the less
terrible for that.</p>

<p>The commonest dog or man driven mad is a much
more alarming creature than the same individuality in
a sober and commonplace condition.</p>

<p>Your friend &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; is setting the world right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
generally all round (including the flattened ends, the
two poles), and, as a Minister said to me the other day,
"has the one little fault of omniscience."</p>

<p>You will probably have read before now that I am
going to be everything the Queen can make me.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> If
my authority be worth anything believe on it that I am
going to be nothing but what I am, and that that includes
my being as long as I live,</p>

<p>I have just time to tell you under my own hand
that I invited Mr. Bear to a dinner of such guests as he
would naturally like to see, and that we took to him
very much, and got on with him capitally.</p>

<p>I am doubtful whether Plorn is taking to Australia.
Can you find out his real mind? I notice that he always
writes as if his present life were the be-all and the end-all
of his emigration, and as if I had no idea of you two
becoming proprietors, and aspiring to the first positions
in the colony, without casting off the old connection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p><p>From Mr. Bear I had the best accounts of you. I
told him that they did not surprise me, for I had unbounded
faith in you. For which take my love and
blessing.</p>

<p>They will have told you all the news here, and that
I am hard at work. This is not a letter so much as an
assurance that I never think of you without hope and
comfort.</p>

<h3>THE ILLUSTRATED LIBRARY EDITION.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>Complete in 30 Volumes. Demy 8vo, 10s. each; or set, &pound;15.</i></div>

<p>This Edition is printed on a finer paper and in a larger type than has been
employed in any previous edition. The type has been cast especially for it, and
the page is of a size to admit of the introduction of all the original illustrations.</p>


<p>No such attractive issue has been made of the writings of Mr. Dickens, which,
various as have been the forms of publication adapted to the demands of an ever
widely-increasing popularity, have never yet been worthily presented in a really
handsome library form.</p>


<p>The collection comprises all the minor writings it was Mr. Dickens's wish to
preserve.</p>
